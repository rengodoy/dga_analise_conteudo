    abstract = {This paper analyses the implementation of the Open Government Data strategy and portal of the City of Vienna. This evaluation is based on qualitative interviews and online polls after the strategy was implemented. Two groups of users were involved in the evaluation: internal target groups (employees and heads of department in the City of Vienna's public administration departments) and external stakeholders (citizens, business representatives, science and research, journalists). Analyzed aspects included the present organizational processes, the benefits (to business and society), and requirements for future Open Government Data initiatives. This evaluation reveals success factors which accompanied the implementation: the clear definition of responsibilities and the implementation along a process model, the integration of the Open Government Data platform into existing Content Management Systems, the evaluation of the Open Government Data initiative very shortly after its inception. Based on the theoretical and empirical findings, recommendations for future Open Government Data strategies are made which target the local authority and would require action on the federal level such as Creative Commons Attribution License as the default for subsidy funds or public relation measures carried out directly by the data providing departments. © 2014 Universidad de Talca - Chile.},

    abstract = {The perceived benefits and possibilities that the production, publication and consumption of Open Government Data (OGD) can provide to citizens and the economy are well documented. In the UK, this has resulted in the introduction of key legislation, such as the Freedom of Information Act 2010, and the Data Protection Act 2018. However, there is insufficient empirical knowledge and evidence to support the extent as to which the intended possibilities of OGD (transparency, releasing social and commercial value, and participation and engagement) have been realized. This article investigates these supposed possibilities and suggests that they may be impossibilities instead. IMPACT: Open government data has long been widely heralded as a mechanism to underpin policy-making, improve citizen engagement, and stimulate innovation. Despite the wealth of literature disputing these aspects individually, this article challenges the perceived benefits collectively against a backdrop of changing political climate and policy. The authors challenge three perceived benefits surrounding the production, consumption and publication of open government data and provide additional considerations that can be made to increase the efficiency and impact of open government data. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

    abstract = {Background: Due to the emerging global interest in Open Government Data, research papers on various topics in this area have increased. Objectives: This paper aims to categorise Open government data research. Methods/Approach: A literature review was conducted to provide a complete overview and classification of open government data research. Hierarchical clustering, a cluster analysis method, was used, and a hierarchy of clusters on selected data sets emerged. Results: The results of this study suggest that there are two distinct clusters of research, which either focus on government perspectives and policies on OGD, initiatives, and portals or focus on regional studies, adoption of OGD, platforms, and barriers to implementation. Further findings suggest that research gaps could be segmented into many thematic areas, focusing on success factors, best practices, the impact of open government data, barriers/challenges in implementing open government data, etc. Conclusions: The extension of the paper, which was first presented at the Entrenova conference, provides a comprehensive overview of research to date on the implementation of OGD and points out that this topic has already received research attention, which focuses on specific segments of the phenomenon and signifies in which direction new research should be made.  © 2022 Aljaž Ferencek et al.},

    abstract = {While the number of open government data initiatives has increased considerably over the past decade, the impact of these initiatives remains uncertain. Recent studies have been critical of the “bias toward the supply side” and lack of “sufficient attention to the user perspective” in the way that open government data initiatives are implemented. This article asks: (1) who is using municipal open government data resources and for what purposes? and (2) what impact are municipal open government data having in cities where they have been implemented? We performed a qualitative analysis of 26 semi-structured telephone interviews conducted with government staff, civic technologists, and private sector stakeholders in nine cities around the United States. Each of these 30 to 45-minute telephone interviews were transcribed and analyzed to distill insights regarding the use and impact of municipal open government data in the nine cities considered. We find that the array of actors within open government data ecosystems at the local level is expanding as distinctions between the public and private sectors becomes increasingly blurred and that the demands of managing and sustaining these initiatives has led to changes in the services offered by local government, as well as in the duties of government staff. The impact of these data resources has been primarily felt within local government itself, although the lack of monitoring mechanisms makes it difficult to systematically evaluate their broader effects. We conclude that open government data initiatives should be coordinated and better integrated with digital equity and digital inclusion efforts in order to advance their political and social goals. © 2020 The Author(s)},

    abstract = {Open government and open data are often presented as the Asterix and
Obelix of modern government-one cannot discuss one, without involving
the other. Modern government, in this narrative, should open itself up,
be more transparent, and allow the governed to have a say in their
governance. The usage of technologies, and especially the communication
of governmental data, is then thought to be one of the crucial
instruments helping governments achieving these goals. Much open
government data research, hence, focuses on the publication of open
government data, their reuse, and re-users. Recent research trends, by
contrast, divert from this focus on data and emphasize the importance of
studying open government data in practice, in interaction with
practitioners, while simultaneously paying attention to their political
character. This commentary looks more closely at the implications of
emphasizing the practical and political dimensions of open government
data. It argues that researchers should explicate how and in what way
open government data policies present solutions to what kind of
problems. Such explications should be based on a detailed empirical
analysis of how different actors do or do not do open data. The key
question to be continuously asked and answered when studying and
implementing open government data is how the solutions openness present
latch onto the problem they aim to solve.},

    abstract = {The exponentially growing production of data and the social trend towards openness and sharing are power-ful forces that are changing the global economy and society. Governments around the world have become ac-tive participants in this evolution, opening up their data for access and re-use by public and private agents alike. The phenomenon of Open Government Data has spread around the world in the last four years, driven by the widely held belief that use of Open Government Data has the ability to generate both economic and social value. However, a cursory review of the popular press, as well as an investigation of academic research and empirical data, reveals the need to further understand the relationship between Open Government Data and value. In this paper, we focus on how use of Open Government Data can bring about new innovative solutions that can gen-erate social and economic value. We apply a critical realist approach to a case study analysis to uncover the mechanisms that can explain how data is transformed to value. We explore the case of Opower, a pioneer in using and transforming data to induce a behavioral change that has resulted in a considerable reduction in en-ergy use over the last six years. © 2014 Universidad de Talca - Chile.},

First, we gather, clean, and merge different datasets released by institutions such as the Open Knowledge Foundation, World Bank, United Nations, World Economic Forum, Transparency International, Economist Intelligence Unit, and International Telecommunication Union. Then, we conduct feature extraction and variable selection founded on economic domain knowledge. Next, we perform several linear regression models, testing whether cross-country differences in the supply of open government data can be explained by differences in the country’s economic, social, and institutional structures. Our analysis provides evidence that the country’s civil liberties, government transparency, quality of democracy, efficiency of government intervention, economies of scale in the provision of public goods, and the size of the economy are statistically significant to explain the cross-country differences in the supply of open government data. Our analysis also suggests that political participation, sociodemographic characteristics, and demographic and global income distribution dummies do not help to explain the country’s supply of open government data. In summary, we show that cross-country differences in governance, social institutions, and the size of the economy can explain the global distribution of open government data. © 2020 by the authors.

    abstract = {The past decade has witnessed a rapid development of open government data practices and academic research. However, there is no systematic survey of existing research to understand the evolution of open government data. Such research can facilitate knowledge transfer within and across domains, and foster learning for countries in the early stages of open government data development. This study quantitively extracted the evolution trajectory of open government data based on the main path analysis method and then analysed the underlying motivations. The results show that open government data research went through four main phases and that the open government data movement has spread towards developing countries and smart cities. Different challenges and issues faced by the researchers in each phase drove the evolution of open government data research. Finally, we discuss future directions of open government data research based on our findings and recent development. There is a tendency to create sustainable open government data and smartness by employing artificial intelligence and creating data marketplaces. Points for practitioners: Open government data efforts have evolved over the years into a global phenomenon. Countries have learned from each other and more and more efforts are focused on innovating with open government data by stimulating co-creation and using other incentives. The way that data are opened should focus on achieving goals like innovation, participation, transparency and accountability. There is a tendency to create sustainable open government data and smartness by employing artificial intelligence and creating data marketplaces. © The Author(s) 2021.},

    abstract = {Purpose This paper presents the results of an online survey and subsequent interviews investigating whether, how, and why public administrations of Brazilian states and the federal district (Federation Units) use open government data. According to the literature reviewed, the questions were categorized into four big groups: benefits, barriers, enablers, and drivers. Design/Methodology/Approach The Survey method, based on a questionnaire followed by interviews, was used to collect and analyze data from the open data officers of 26 Brazilian Federation Units. Findings The use of open government data is controversial as responses from the questionnaires and interviews do not match and raise questions about how well-represented each Federation Unit was. Evidence of open government data use was found. Among others, findings showed that political leadership committed to using open data facilitates and motivates public agents to use these data. Additionally, interviews indicated that the lack of human resources with the knowledge, skills, and capabilities to use open data is a relevant barrier to data use. Findings also revealed that open government data mainly support policy and decision-making processes. Practical implications This research contributed to the open data and public administration fields. It portrays diverse realities of open government data use and institutionalization in Brazilian state and district public administrations. In addition, it provides lists of open government data use benefits, barriers, drivers, and enablers from the perspective of these administrations so that they can benchmark against each other and improve their OGD use. © 2024 Kawashita et al.

    abstract = {The objective of this article is to use the DGABr, an alternative metric created, in a doctoral thesis of 2018, to evaluate the Open Government Data of Brazil, to measure the open government data of other Latin American countries. The overall objective was subdivided into three specific objectives: (1) Identify the countries of Latin America that have defined access to information/open data policy legislation; (2) Identify the most comprehensive legislation and criteria for assessing open government data; and (3) Analyze the DGABr based on other legislation and propose adjustments for its use in other countries. In this sense, the legislation on access to information of Latin American countries was investigated, based on the Global Right to Information Rating ranking, which assesses legislation on access to information worldwide. The legislation of Mexico was chosen as reference for comparison with the DGABr, having reached in the ranking, the highest score in Latin America. Analyzing Mexican legislation, items to be included in the DGABr were identified and many similarities were already evaluated by the DGABr. It is concluded that the DGABr allows adaptations and can be used in different contexts and countries of Latin America. © 2019 Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Campinas. All rights reserved.},

However, there is a lack of knowledge of the extent to which the objectives of open government data initiatives are achieved. This article investigates the relationship between the objectives of open government data initiatives and the benefits delivered. A total of 168 survey responses concerning 156 open government data initiatives at different government levels worldwide suggest that operational and technical benefits are the benefits most often delivered, followed by economic benefits and, finally, societal benefits. Surprisingly, our study suggests that whether an open government data initiative delivers a benefit (e.g. increased openness, trust or innovation) is not significantly affected by having an objective related to the delivery of that benefit. The objectives of state- and national-level open government data initiatives are more often achieved than those of local- and regional-level open government data initiatives. © The Author(s) 2018.},

    abstract = {Purpose: Open government data and access to public sector information is commonplace, yet little attention has focussed on the essential roles and responsibilities in practice of the information and records management professionals, who enable public authorities to deliver open data to citizens. This paper aims to consider the perspectives of open government and information practitioners in England on the procedural and policy implications of open data across local public authorities. Design/methodology/approach: Using four case studies from different parts of the public sector in England (local government, higher education, National Health Service and hospital trust), the research involved master’s level students in the data collection and analysis, alongside academics, thus enhancing the learning experience of students. Findings: There was little consistency in the location of responsibility for open government data policy, the range of job roles involved or the organisational structures, policy and guidance in place to deliver this function. While this may reflect the organisational differences and professional concerns, it makes it difficult to share best practice. Central government policy encourages public bodies to make their data available for re-use. However, local practice is very variable and perhaps understandably responds more to local organisational strategic and resource priorities. The research found a lack of common metadata standards for open data, different choices about which data to open, problems of data redundancy, inconsistency and data integrity and a wide variety of views on the corporate and public benefits of open data. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to England and to non-national public bodies and only draws data from a small number of case studies. Originality/value: The research contributes to the debate about emerging issues around the complexities of open government data and its public benefits, contributing to the discussions around technology-enabled approaches to citizen engagement and governance. It offers new insights into the interaction between open data and public policy objectives, drawing on the experience of local public sectors in England. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Open government data are claimed to contribute to transparency, citizen participation, collaboration, economic and public service development. From an innovation perspective, we explore the current gap between the promise and practice of open government data. Based on Strategic Niche Management (SNM), we identify different phases in the open data innovation process. This study uses a living lab in a province in the Netherlands to stimulate the provision and use of open data for collaborative processes and analyses the mechanisms that condition the success of this innovation process. The results based on six interventions over a period of two years show that our interventions stimulated the use of open data and raised awareness within government, but that various mechanisms inhibited the realization of the ambitions of open government data. We conclude that the challenge of open government data as an innovation lies in finding a way to scale up the provision of open data: innovation niches are established but “regime changes” do not take place. Scaling up open government data use requires strong managerial commitment and changes in the wider organizational landscape such as constructing formal and informal rules and technological developments that stimulate debate about open data practices. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

    abstract = {This article contributes to the growing body of literature within public management on open government data by taking a political perspective. We argue that open government data are a strategic resource of organizations and therefore organizations are not likely to share it. We develop an analytical framework for studying the politics of open government data, based on theories of strategic responses to institutional processes, government transparency, and open government data. The framework shows that there can be different organizational strategic responses to open data—varying from conformity to active resistance—and that different institutional antecedents influence these responses. The value of the framework is explored in two cases: a province in the Netherlands and a municipality in France. The cases provide insights into why governments might release datasets in certain policy domains but not in others thereby producing “strategically opaque transparency.” The article concludes that the politics of open government data framework helps us understand open data practices in relation to broader institutional pressures that influence government transparency. © The Author(s) 2019.},

Although the potential economic value of open (government) data is assessed in millions and billions, not all open data are reused. Moreover, the open (government) data initiative as well as users’ intent for open (government) data are changing continuously and today, in line with IoT and smart city trends, real-time data and sensor-generated data have higher interest for users. These “smarter” open (government) data are also considered to be one of the crucial drivers for the sustainable economy, and might have an impact on information and communication technology (ICT) innovation and become a creativity bridge in developing a new ecosystem in Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0. The paper inspects OGD portals of 60 countries in order to understand the correspondence of their content to the Society 5.0 expectations. The paper provides a report on how much countries provide these data, focusing on some open (government) data success facilitating factors for both the portal in general and data sets of interest in particular. The presence of “smarter” data, their level of accessibility, availability, currency and timeliness, as well as support for users, are analyzed. The list of most competitive countries by data category are provided. This makes it possible to understand which OGD portals react to users’ needs, Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 request the opening and updating of data for their further potential reuse, which is essential in the digital data-driven world. © 2021 by the author.

    abstract = {The development of open government data has attracted interest from academics and practitioners. However, only a few studies have examined a culture-based account of open government data development. This study empirically investigates the impact of national culture on open government data. Through the data investigation and analysis of 55 countries, this research finds that the development of open government data is positively linked with national culture with respect to individualism, indulgence and long-term orientation and is negatively related to power distance. Furthermore, this study shows that economic development moderates the relationship between national culture and open government data development, especially with respect to individualism and long-term orientation. Practically, the findings of this research can help policymakers better understand the multifaceted impacts of national culture on the development of open government data, including the promotion of cultural values (i.e. high individualism, high indulgence, and high long-term orientation) and the change in the passive and conservative attitude of citizens toward the openness of government data in countries where power distance culture is high. © The Author(s) 2023.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this exploratory study is to provide modern local governments with potential use cases for their open data, in order to help inform related future policies and decision-making. The concrete context was that of the Växjö municipality located in southeastern Sweden. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology was two-fold: 1) a survey of potential end users (n=151) from a local university; and, 2) analysis of survey results using a theoretical model regarding local strategies for implementing open government data. Findings: Most datasets predicted to be useful were on: sustainability and environment; preschool and school; municipality and politics. The use context given is primarily research and development, informing policies and decision making; but also education, informing personal choices, informing citizens and creating services based on open data. Not the least, the need for educating target user groups on data literacy emerged. A tentative pattern comprising a technical perspective on open data and a social perspective on open government was identified. Research limitations: In line with available funding, the nature of the study was exploratory and implemented as an anonymous web-based survey of employees and students at the local university. Further research involving (qualitative) surveys with all stakeholders would allow for creating a more complete picture of the matter. Practical implications: The study determines potential use cases and use contexts for open government data, in order to help inform related future policies and decision-making. Originality/value: Modern local governments, and especially in Sweden, are faced with a challenge of how to make their data open, how to learn about which types of data will be most relevant for their end users and what will be different societal purposes. The paper contributes to knowledge that modern local governments can resort to when it comes to attitudes of local citizens to open government data in the context of an open government data perspective. © 2021 Sciendo.

    abstract = {An understanding of the similar and divergent metrics and methodologies underlying open government data benchmarks can reduce the risks of the potential misinterpretation and misuse of benchmarking outcomes by policymakers, politicians, and researchers. Hence, this study aims to compare the metrics and methodologies used to measure, benchmark, and rank governments' progress in open government data initiatives. Using a critical meta-analysis approach, we compare nine benchmarks with reference to meta-data, meta-methods, and meta-theories. This study finds that both existing open government data benchmarks and academic open data progress models use a great variety of metrics and methodologies, although open data impact is not usually measured. While several benchmarks’ methods have changed over time, and variables measured have been adjusted, we did not identify a similar pattern for academic open data progress models. This study contributes to open data research in three ways: 1) it reveals the strengths and weaknesses of existing open government data benchmarks and academic open data progress models; 2) it reveals that the selected open data benchmarks employ relatively similar measures as the theoretical open data progress models; and 3) it provides an updated overview of the different approaches used to measure open government data initiatives’ progress. Finally, this study offers two practical contributions: 1) it provides the basis for combining the strengths of benchmarks to create more comprehensive approaches for measuring governments’ progress in open data initiatives; and 2) it explains why particular countries are ranked in a certain way. This information is essential for governments and researchers to identify and propose effective measures to improve their open data initiatives. © 2021 The Authors},

    abstract = {Over the past 10 years, we have observed a significant growth in open data adoption in governments across the globe. Potential barriers and enablers of open government data have been well-documented in the literature. However, nearly all of this research has been conducted in Western, democratic and developed societies, with very little known about open government data implementation in less developed countries. This article investigates how institutional dimensions affect open data implementation in six understudied countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. This research presents rich data based on an analysis of 31 documents and focus group discussions with a total of 89 participants. In general, we find that in these countries the same institutional dimensions influence OGD implementation as in their Western counterparts. A striking difference, however, is that we find open data implementation in transition countries to be much more fragile and highly dependent on foreign aid initiatives. This paper also strengthens the argument that institutional dimensions explain the performance of open data implementation. © 2020 The Author(s).

    abstract = {In recent years, the governments in many countries have recognized the importance of data in boosting their economies. As a result, they are implementing the philosophy of open government data (OGD) to make public data easily and freely available to everyone in standardized formats. Because good quality OGD can boost a country’s economy, whereas poor quality can jeopardize its efficient use and reuse, it is very important to maintain the quality of data stored in open government data portals (OGDP). However, most OGDPs do not have a feature that indicates the quality of the data stored there, and even if they do, they do not provide real‐time service. Moreover, most recent studies focused on developing approaches to quantify the quality of OGD, either qualitatively or quantitatively, but did not offer an approach to automatically calculate and visualize it in real‐time. To address this problem to some extent, this paper proposes a framework that can automatically assess the quality of data in the form of a data completeness ratio (DCR) and visualize it in real‐time. The framework is validated using the OGD of South Korea, whose DCR is displayed in real‐time using the Django‐based dashboard. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Results indicate that data variables, basic resources, organizational arrangement and technical capacity are directly related to the OGDC of government agencies; power distance negatively moderates the relationship between organizational structure and OGDC; uncertainty avoidance moderates the relationship among basic resources, organizational arrangement and OGDC.

    abstract = {This study discusses how a model based on Fricitionless Data (FD) can facilitate the publication of open government data (DAGs). FD is an initiative of the Open Knowledge Foundation, which aims to eliminate "friction" in working with data, that is, when much time and resources are lost to understand and work with the data. Within public institutions, the lack of standards for publication and processing of DAGs is a common problem when it comes to opening DAGs. The study tried to contribute by applying the model to the set of data with information on good practices executed by the Judiciary related to the Objectives of Sustainable Development (ODS). Through a bibliographic survey, the main characteristics found in the models for opening DOGS and barriers inherent to the publication process, were identified in the literature. The laboratory research technique was used to describe and analyze the application of the proposed model in a controlled environment for specific purposes of this work. The model was based on Data Publication Workflow, a data publication flow available at the Frictionless Data initiative website that addresses steps such as data packaging, treatment and publication. The implementation of the model also used open source tools based on Frictionless Data. The results showed the feasibility of the model for opening up a set of open government data, as well as demonstrated that the tools available in the Frictionless Data initiative contributed to the verification of the steps in the model. It was concluded that the model needs validation in other contexts, such as integration and opening of different public databases related to ODS. © 2020 Universidade Estadual de Campinas.

To do so, public organizations must consider which elements might help the development of their open government data portals (OGDP). This paper studies the evolution of OGDP in the 28 countries of the European Union (EU) in a multidisciplinary setting. Whereas the comparative frameworks in the literature are mostly based only on technological parameters, this exploratory research aims to uncover which factors might uphold the successful development of OGDP through the analysis of the relationships between a number of technical and socioeconomical indicators over a period of three years (2015–2017), using a clustering methodology. The results show that EU countries are slowly homogenizing their OGD approaches into two currents/speeds, based mainly on economic factors and open government development status. The originality of this research lies in the sense that it provides not only a technical benchmark, but also a longitudinal and multidisciplinary perspective that will add to the current formulation of OGD policies and practices in any international setting. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

comprised three phases. Firstly, we conducted a pretest on open data
portals from the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil and Ireland,
motivated by studies on the history of the open data movement as well as
the current panorama of initiatives, evolution stages and challenges,
which defined the fundamental analytical dimensions for the proposed
maturity model. Secondly, we developed a maturity diagnosis model for
open government data portals. Finally, the model was applied and
validated on the pre-tested portals. Results from the diagnosis
instrument can guide public administration in realizing a more efficient
and responsible data governance, benefiting the government, the open
data movement and civil society.},

    abstract = {Open government data (OGD) initiatives are an emergent platform research topic. There is little understanding how these platforms are governed for the innovation of services using open data, where the cultivation of an installed base of heterogeneous service innovators can lead to increased usage of OGD. In this paper, we draw on established literature from digital platforms research to investigate how service innovation is cultivated in open government data contexts. We employ a comparative case study of open government data platforms in three leading Latin American cities and draw upon the concept of boundary resources taken from platform theory. Our research generates two key contributions. First, we propose a theoretical model, which explains how an OGD platform owner is able to govern the demand and the supply side of its platform to facilitate the cultivation of a platform ecosystem. Second, we develop contributions to practice in terms of a set of recommendations for governments in emerging countries concerning how to establish and manage a vibrant OGD platform ecosystem. © 2020},

    abstract = {In the context of big data, opening government data to society for development and utilization would improve the transparency of government work and promote harmonious social development. Improving the sustainability of open government data (OGD) is an important and challenging issue, and has received the attention of multiple governments. The goals of this study are to construct a new evaluation model for the sustainability of OGD that explores the main influential factors and amends the priorities. We used a combination of the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method and the Analytical Network Process (ANP) method known as DANP to construct an influential network relationship map (INRM) of the evaluation system and calculate the criterion weights. The INRM and weights can help decision makers understand the complex assessment system and set priorities for improving OGD. The results demonstrate that the improvement priorities of dimensions have the following order: impact (D4), use (D3), data (D2), and environment (D1). Economic, social, and political values are the three critical factors for improvement of the sustainability of OGD. Some implications for management are also provided. © 2019 by the authors.},

OGD have huge potential in this regard. This paper focuses on the assessment of how quality aspect of OGD influences their utilization for obtaining useful information needed for enhancing environmental protection. Our evaluation considers factors such as dataset quality, information value, smartness, and legislative compliance. Research findings suggest that open government datasets pertaining to environmental protection require further refinement to improve their information gain. Furthermore, we discuss legal aspect of open data provision as a valuable factor which can contribute to the successful adoption of open data for environmental protection. © 2023 Scientific Publishers.

    abstract = {During recent years, the amount of data released on platforms by public administrations around the world have exploded. Open government data platforms are aimed at enhancing transparency and participation. Even though the promises of these platforms are high, their full potential has not yet been reached. Scholars have identified technical and quality barriers of open data usage. Although useful, these issues fail to acknowledge that the meaning of open data also depends on the context and people involved. In this study we analyze open data usage from a practice lens – as a social construction that emerges over time in interaction with governments and users in a specific context – to enhance our understanding of the role of context and agency in the development of open data platforms. This study is based on innovative action-based research in which civil servants’ and citizens’ initiatives collaborate to find solutions for public problems using an open data platform. It provides an insider perspective of Open Data Work. The findings show that an absence of a shared cognitive framework for understanding open data and a lack of high-quality datasets can prevent processes of collaborative learning. Our contextual approach stresses the need for open data practices that work on the basis of rich interactions with users rather than government-centric implementations. © The Author(s) 2018.},

As a modular and scalable solution to fragmented government data, Linked Open Government Data (LOGD) improve citizens’ understanding of government functions while promoting greater data interoperability, ultimately leading to more efficient government processes. However, despite promising developments in the early 2010s, including the release of LOGD datasets by some government agencies, and studies and methodological proposals by numerous scholars, a cursory examination of government websites and portals suggests that interest in this technology has gradually waned. Given the initial expectations surrounding LOGD, this paper goes beyond a superficial analysis and provides a deeper insight into the evolution of interest in LOGD by raising questions about the extent to which the dream of LD has influenced the reality of OGD and whether it remains sustainable. © 2024 by the authors.},

However, there appears to be a lack of scholarly literature that empirically validates what this value is or how it emerges. This paper addresses this concern by exploring what empirical evidence currently exists about the effects stemming from OGD in the case literature. Through the use of a literature review, 17 papers capturing empirical evidence were identified and, from these papers, a systematic collection of statements was extracted from which 173 were retained to construct what we term nine stylised facts.

    abstract = {Citizens are at the heart of open government, and their participation represents a fundamental principle of the latter. Despite their essential role and the great potential benefits open government holds for the public, challenges of use among citizens persist. Previous empirical research has scarcely addressed these issues from a citizen perspective. This study investigates the determinants of open government data use by citizens in Germany. Our results indicate that ease of use, usefulness, as well as transparency, participation and collaboration expectancies significantly determine citizens’ intention to use open government data, which in turn positively affects their word-of-mouth intention. Overall, the findings not only contribute to our understanding of citizen behavior in the context of open government research, especially shedding light on the key aspects of citizens’ usage intention, but also provide implications for both researchers and practitioners. Points for practitioners: Citizen-based use of open government data (OGD) has multiple facets that practitioners should be aware of. Public administration needs to take account of the important role of accessibility and usability in providing OGD services, with the objective of meeting the major challenge of enabling equal access for all populations via appropriate channels and customization. The content-related preparation of OGD services should seek to enhance transparency, participation and collaboration, raising and shaping respective expectations among citizens. Finally, practitioners should pay particular attention to the opportunities and risks associated with word-of-mouth communication in the context of OGD. © The Author(s) 2017.},

    abstract = {In election times, political parties promise in their manifestos to pass reforms increasing access to government information to root out corruption and improve public service delivery. Scholars have already offered several fascinating explanations of why governments adopt transparency policies that constrain their choices. However, knowledge of their impacts is limited. Does greater access to information deliver on its promises as an anti-corruption policy? While some research has already addressed this question in relation to freedom of information laws, the emergence of new digital technologies enabled new policies, such as open government data. Its effects on corruption remain empirically underexplored due to its novelty and a lack of measurements. In this article, I provide the first empirical study of the relationship between open government data, relative to FOI laws, and corruption. I propose a theoretical framework, which specifies conditions necessary for FOI laws and open government data to affect corruption levels, and I test it on a novel cross-country dataset. The results suggest that the effects of open government data on corruption are conditional upon the quality of media and internet freedom. Moreover, other factors, such as free and fair elections, independent and accountable judiciary, or economic development, are far more critical for tackling corruption than increasing access to information. These findings are important for policies. In particular, digital transparency reforms will not yield results in the anti-corruption fight unless robust provisions safeguarding media and internet freedom complement them. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

    abstract = {Objective of the study: This article aims to identify the theoretical
approaches adopted internationally in the last five years in Open
Government Data (DGA) studies.
Methodology/approach: We decided to perform a Systematic Literature
Review (RSA), guided by the Kitchenham protocol (2007), supported by the
ATLAS.ti tool. The analyzes covered twenty-seven studies conducted in
nineteen countries.
Originality/relevance: The theoretical relevance of the work reflects
the identification of the theoretical support of research on DGA and the
verification of the presence of the elements for the constitution of a
school of thought on the subject.
Main results: From the analyzed studies emerges the discussion of
theoretical elements about the open data itself - such as concepts,
requirements, barriers and benefits - and associated theories - such as
Institutional Theory, Cognitive Theory, Informational State Theory,
Ecosystem Theory, Interagency Information, from the Multi-Level
Perspective and Cross-boundary or Interorganizational, signaling the
absence of a school of thought that brings together scholars of the
subject. Moreover, the potential of open data policies to further
strengthen democracy, generate economic value, innovations and
technical-managerial advances in public organizations is also revealed.
Theoretical/methodological contributions: The main theoretical
contribution is the knowledge of the main theoretical approaches
associated with DGA, and the methodological contribution to the rigorous
development of an RSA protocol and thematic analysis itself supported by
qualitative analysis software.
Social/management contributions: Social contribution refers to the
survey of benefits and barriers of initiatives in DGA, which if explored
can lead to a closer relationship between governments and citizens.},

    abstract = {Open Government Data (OGD) have the potential to support social and economic progress. However, this potential can be frustrated if these data remain unused. Although the literature suggests that OGD data sets’ metadata quality is one of the main factors affecting their use, to the best of our knowledge, no quantitative study provided evidence of this relationship. Considering about 400,000 data sets of 28 national, municipal and international OGD portals, we have programmatically analysed their usage, their metadata quality and the relationship between the two. Our analysis has highlighted three main findings. First, regardless of their size, the software platform adopted, and their administrative and territorial coverage, most OGD data sets are underutilised. Second, OGD portals pay varying attention to the quality of their data sets’ metadata. Third, we did not find clear evidence that data sets’ usage is positively correlated to better metadata publishing practices. Finally, we have considered other factors, such as data sets’ category, and some demographic characteristics of the OGD portals, and analysed their relationship with data sets’ usage, obtaining partially affirmative answers. © The Author(s) 2021.},

This study investigates the impact of the perceived quality of data, systems, and services on citizens’ trust in OGD, with the information systems success model as the theoretical framework. A questionnaire was delivered electronically to reach OGD users around the world. A total of 358 complete responses were obtained, representing 63.58% of all responses. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the hypothesized relationships between constructs based on users’ responses. The findings confirm the impact of data, system, and service quality on citizens’ perceived trust in OGD. Moreover, perceived system and service quality had a positive impact on perceived data quality, and perceived service quality had a positive effect on perceived system quality. These findings indicate that OGD service quality affects data and system quality, making it the most fundamental motivator of citizens’ trust in OGD. This highlights the role of open government platforms in developing public services and providing users with complete and correct data, feedback tools, and data visualization. © 2022 by the authors.},

    abstract = {The diffusion of Open Government Data (OGD) in recent years kept a very fast pace. However, evidence from practitioners shows that disclosing data without proper quality control may jeopardize dataset reuse and negatively affect civic participation. Current approaches to the problem in literature lack a comprehensive theoretical framework. Moreover, most of the evaluations concentrate on open data platforms, rather than on datasets.In this work, we address these two limitations and set up a framework of indicators to measure the quality of Open Government Data on a series of data quality dimensions at most granular level of measurement. We validated the evaluation framework by applying it to compare two cases of Italian OGD datasets: an internationally recognized good example of OGD, with centralized disclosure and extensive data quality controls, and samples of OGD from decentralized data disclosure (municipality level), with no possibility of extensive quality controls as in the former case, hence with supposed lower quality.Starting from measurements based on the quality framework, we were able to verify the difference in quality: the measures showed a few common acquired good practices and weaknesses, and a set of discriminating factors that pertain to the type of datasets and the overall approach. On the basis of this evaluation, we also provided technical and policy guidelines to overcome the weaknesses observed in the decentralized release policy, addressing specific quality aspects. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

This paper constructs a knowledge graph for the disease-related datasets of a Canadian government data portal, Nova Scotia Open Data. We leveraged the Semantic Web technologies to transform the disease-related datasets into Resource Description Framework (RDF) and enriched them with semantic rules. An RDF data model using the RDF Cube vocabulary was designed in this work to develop a graph that adheres to best practices and standards, allowing for expansion, modification and flexible re-use.

    abstract = {Urban villages refer to the residential areas lagging behind the rapid urbanization process in many developing countries. These areas are usually with overcrowded buildings, high population density, and low living standards, bringing potential risks of public safety and hindering the urban development. Therefore, it is crucial for urban authorities to identify the boundaries of urban villages and estimate their resident and floating populations so as to better renovate and manage these areas. Traditional approaches, such as field surveys and demographic census, are time consuming and labor intensive, lacking a comprehensive understanding of urban villages. Against this background, we propose a two-phase framework for urban village boundary identification and population estimation. Specifically, based on heterogeneous open government data, the proposed framework can not only accurately identify the boundaries of urban villages from large-scale satellite imagery by fusing road networks guided patches with bike-sharing drop-off patterns, but also accurately estimate the resident and floating populations of urban villages with a proposed multi-view neural network model. We evaluate our method leveraging real-world datasets collected from Xiamen Island. Results show that our framework can accurately identify the urban village boundaries with an IoU of 0.827, and estimate the resident population and floating population with R2 of 0.92 and 0.94 respectively, outperforming the baseline methods. We also deploy our system on the Xiamen Open Government Data Platform to provide services to both urban authorities and citizens. © 2021 ACM.},

    abstract = {Over the last decade, many Open Data initiatives have been launched by public administrations to promote transparency and reuse of data. However, it is not easy to assess the impact of data availability from the perspective of user communities. Although some Open Data portals provide mechanisms for user feedback through dedicated discussion forums or web forms, and some of the user experiences are reported directly in the portals, there is no consistent way to compare user feedback in different data initiatives. To overcome the difficulty of assessing user impact, this paper examines the activity generated by Open Data initiatives through the social network X (formerly Twitter): a forum used by all types of stakeholders and publicly available for consistent analysis. This work proposes a methodology for analysing the evolution of Open Government Data initiatives and their user engagement along a temporal period. First, a set of variables are collected to describe the main features of Open Data initiatives and their associated social network activity. Then, to analyse these collected data from a multidimensional and temporal perspective, we apply the well-known technique of self-organizing maps to find hidden correlations between the status of different initiatives in the analysed period. Finally, as the number of map nodes is still too big to identify clear levels of maturity, a clustering algorithm is applied to group initiatives with a similar evolution status. The feasibility of this methodology has been tested by analysing 27 European Open Government Data portals between 2017 and 2021. © 2013 IEEE.},

    abstract = {Open data has a large means of identifying commonly reachable information on different platforms. One of the open data sources is open government data. The goals of open governments are about building transparency, accountability and participation to strengthen governance and inform citizens. The aim of this study is twofold: (i) to propose a reliable decision-making tool for dealing with real-life problems and (ii) to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed model through a case study of its ranking with an open government data indicator for G20 countries. This study proposes a multi-criteria methodology that evaluates open data management systems used in e-government development. First, a set of evaluation criteria is established that cover the indicators used in the Global Open Data Index. Second, weights from the Logarithm Methodology of Additive Weights (LMAW) and Logarithmic Percentage Change-driven Objective Weighting (LOPCOW) methods were combined with the Bayesian approach to determine the weights of these criteria. Finally, the Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method was used to obtain the ranking results. The novelties of the study lie in the combination of objective and subjective weighting methods, both in determining the ranking of G20 countries with open government data indicators and in deciding the importance levels of the criteria used. The “air quality” and “procurement” criteria are the top two criteria, with weights of 0,1378 and 0,1254 respectively. The findings also show that Australia is the best performer, while the United Kingdom is the second best performing. Comprehensive sensitivity analysis verifies the validity, robustness and effectiveness of the proposed framework. According to research findings and analysis, the methodology applied has the potential to assist policymakers and decision-makers in the process of modernization of existing public services in terms of open data and the opportunities it presents. © 2023 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.},

A thematic analysis of interview, observational and policy documentation is presented which suggests that since 2010 the Open Government Data agenda has been used strategically by the UK's centre-right coalition government to progress a range of controversial policies, which are aimed at the continuation of the neoliberal form of state through its current crisis. Specifically, the relationship between Open Government Data policy and the neoliberal objectives of the marketisation of public services and privatisation of public assets, the leveraging of financial markets and the pharmaceutical industry, and the embedding of OGD into a broader agenda aimed at rebuilding trust in political elites are analysed. These findings are examined in relation to Braman's (2006, 2011) arguments regarding the strategic implementation of information policy by Governments in the exercising of state power, and the development of the 'informational state'. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

    abstract = {Drawing on a two-year ethnographic study within several French administrations involved in open data programs, this article aims to investigate the conditions of the release of government data – the rawness of which open data policies require. This article describes two sets of phenomena. First, far from being taken for granted, open data emerge in administrations through a progressive process that entails uncertain collective inquiries and extraction work. Second, the opening process draws on a series of transformations, as data are modified to satisfy an important criterion of open data policies: the need for both human and technical intelligibility. There are organizational consequences of these two points, which can notably lead to the visibilization or the invisibilization of data labour. Finally, the article invites us to reconsider the apparent contradiction between the process of data release and the existence of raw data. Echoing the vocabulary of one of the interviewees, the multiple operations can be seen as a ‘rawification’ process by which open government data are carefully generated. Such a notion notably helps to build a relational model of what counts as data and what counts as work. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

    abstract = {In discussions of Open Government Data (hereafter referred to as open data or OGD) in the academic literature, the question of what is meant by the word “open” has to date received only limited attention. The use of Open Government Data (OGD) has spread globally as governments make more of their data available via electronically accessible formats for individuals to use and share. OGD is seen as something that has the potential to play an important role in achieving transparency, and accountability, enabling new forms of civic participation, and stimulates economic growth and development. However, there is a need to examine OGD datasets to determine whether they are truly open. The purpose of this paper is to investigate OGD openness based on a number of existing or proposed open data definitions and principles. The principles proposed by the work of the Open Government Working Group will be analyzed. The methodology that has been used to collect the data includes OGD website content analysis, participant observation and semi-structured interviews using purposeful and snowball sampling techniques. The results in this paper are just part of the overall study. This research has not been funded. The research limitation is that it has been done only in the Irish context. It is an original study with primary data. The conclusion of this research mainly demonstrates that OGD in the Irish context is progressing but requires further work to be open based on the principles proposed by the Open Government Working Group works. © 2022 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

In this regard, the present study seeks to understand how the Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives in Brazil are being confronted with bottlenecks in terms of their execution and acceptability. This exploratory study adopts a qualitative cross-sectional research approach wherein interviews are being conducted with 11 managers working in public organizations and are directly associated with the OGD initiatives. Findings from the interview responses delineate internal and external factors, resource availability, data maintenance, and lack of knowledge as the key determinants for the bottlenecks associated with the execution and acceptability of OGD initiatives by the societal stakeholders. The study's originality lies in its theoretical contribution towards an understanding of how a novel digital innovation-OGD, in the present case- is fraught with impediments in terms of its execution and acceptability. The study concludes with directions for further research and practitioner implications. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

    abstract = {Transparency evaluation in open government is a process of measuring the extent of transparency against a predefined set of indicators. In this paper, we address the existing initiatives regarding data and government transparency evaluation as two separate indicators and present the analysis of their advantages and drawbacks. Based on that analysis, we extend a part of the OpenGovB benchmark related to transparency in open government. What is unique about this benchmark is that it utilizes metadata of data published on the open government data portals to calculate the majority of indicators related to data transparency indicators. For the government transparency indicator evaluation, the benchmark utilizes some of the well-known transparency indi-cators. The article shows concrete results obtained from the application of the defined transparency evaluation model on 22 open data portals, thus demonstrating the possibilities of its application as well as the gains regarding generated results. The proposed model bridges the gap between available methodologies for evaluating transparency based on collaboration and participation and methodologies for evaluating transparency based on open data. © 2022 by the authors.

While some governments are actively adapting to these trends, others remain behind, despite the pressure. This research explores the political and administrative reasons behind these differences. By analyzing how local governments in South Korea handled requests for open data from citizens between 2007 and 2016, the study highlights the importance of political competition and administrative strength in fostering government transparency and effectively addressing citizen data requests. The study assesses open government data based on its scope, time, and quality, finding that higher levels of electoral competition and better administrative capabilities contribute to increased transparency and responsiveness. However, the study's use of a regression discontinuity design reveals that the political party controlling local governments had minimal influence on these factors.

    abstract = {Dynamic data (including environmental, traffic, and sensor data) were recently recognized as an important part of Open Government Data (OGD). Although these data are of vital importance in the development of data intelligence applications, such as business applications that exploit traffic data to predict traffic demand, they are prone to data quality errors produced by, e.g., failures of sensors and network faults. This paper explores the quality of Dynamic Open Government Data. To that end, a single case is studied using traffic data from the official Greek OGD portal. The portal uses an Application Programming Interface (API), which is essential for effective dynamic data dissemination. Our research approach includes assessing data quality using statistical and machine learning methods to detect missing values and anomalies. Traffic flow-speed correlation analysis, seasonal-trend decomposition, and unsupervised isolation Forest (iForest) are used to detect anomalies. iForest anomalies are classified as sensor faults and unusual traffic conditions. The iForest algorithm is also trained on additional features, and the model is explained using explainable artificial intelligence. There are 20.16% missing traffic observations, and 50% of the sensors have 15.5% to 33.43% missing values. The average percent of anomalies per sensor is 71.1%, with only a few sensors having less than 10% anomalies. Seasonal-trend decomposition detected 12.6% anomalies in the data of these sensors, and iForest 11.6%, with very few overlaps. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time a study has explored the quality of dynamic OGD. © 2022 by the authors.},

    abstract = {Corruption represents the misuse of public power by government departments for per-sonal gain, hindering a country’s economic growth. Corruption cannot be eliminated by implementing the national democratic system, and mature democratic countries also exist with varying de-grees of corruption. Corruption affects people’s trust in the public sector and the country’s economic development. Open government data can help people understand the governance performance of the government to reduce corruption in the public sector. Citizens can use open government data to generate innovative applications and economic value. This study uses a two‐stage data envelopment analysis method to assess the anti‐corruption efficiency of 21 countries from 2013 to 2017 through open government data, the corruption perception index, and GDP data. Then, the efficiency analyzed is introduced into the BCG (Boston Consulting Group) matrix to observe the distribution of these 21 countries. Analyzing the results showed that Uruguay and Costa Rica in Central and South America are the two most influential countries in fighting corruption. Turkey is at the bottom in the evaluation of anti‐corruption efficiency. In addition, discussions of the included countries for their possible improvement in anti‐corruption are also provided by using the association rule’s anal-ysis. The study results will provide a reference for governments to effectively carry out anti‐corrup-tion work in the future. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

    abstract = {In recent years, the amount of data in the world is growing rapidly. Data growth also occurs in the government sector. All ministries and institutions at every level are data producers. These government-owned data have a high potential if they can be used properly. Open government data can stimulate innovation and economic growth and enhance business models. In order to increase the willingness of citizens to use open government data and enjoy the benefits mentioned, the quality of open government data needs to be improved. The quality of open government data encompasses a variety of dimensions and criteria. Also, the importance of each dimension and criterion in increasing the quality of open government data is different. Therefore, we are faced with a complex system that requires proper decision-making and management. In fact, we are dealing with decision-making in the complex management system. Given the importance of this issue, the purpose of this study is to provide a new and comprehensive method to improve the quality of open government data and increase the willingness of citizens to use the data by considering the complex network of citizens and organizations. For this purpose, library studies have been used to extract comprehensive and effective dimensions and criteria. The statistical population includes all articles related to the criteria of improving the quality of open government data and increasing the willingness of citizens to use the data. The probabilistic sampling method of simple random samples has been used, and 10 articles in this field have been reviewed. After extracting the criteria as well as the data of 112 governmental organizations and institutions related to each criterion from the open data portal, the complex network of citizens and governmental organizations and institutions has been analyzed in order to identify high-degree centrality organizations. Then, the data characteristics of the organizations that were most desired by the citizens were extracted using data mining techniques including the regression model. Also, field method and multicriteria decision-making technique including the DEMATEL technique have been used to express the solutions and identify the cause-and-effect relationships between the solutions. The criteria extracted in improving the quality of open government data and increasing the willingness of citizens to use the data are included: "data originality,""license openness,""up-to-datedness,""data access,""metadata completeness,""number of data sets,""format openness,""nondiscrimination,""understandable,""number of categories of data sets,""free,""lack of missing data,""data request ability,""visualization,""feedback,"and "data subject matter."Based on the results obtained from the analysis of the complex network and the regression model, the criterion of "society subject"with a coefficient of 72.564 and a positive sign has the greatest impact on increasing the number of citizens' visits to open government data. After that, the criterion of "format openness"with a coefficient of 52.682 and a positive sign has the second rank in increasing the number of visits. Extracting comprehensive and effective criteria in improving the quality of open government data and increasing citizens' willingness to use data, calculating the weight and importance of each criterion by analyzing the complex network of citizens and organizations, as well as providing solutions, can help managers in decision-making and proper management in the complex system of citizens and government organizations. © 2022 Mohammad Moradi et al.},

    abstract = {Open Government Data (OGD), including statistical data, such as
economic, environmental and social indicators, are data published by the
public sector for free reuse. These data have a huge potential when
exploited using Machine Learning methods. Linked Data technologies
facilitate retrieving integrated statistical indicators by defining and
executing SPARQL queries. However, statistical indicators are available
in different temporal and spatial granularity levels as well using
different units of measurement. This data article describes the
integrated statistical indicators that were retrieved from the official
Scottish data portal in order to facilitate the exploitation of Machine
Learning methods in OGD. Multiple SPARQL queries as well as manual
search in the data portal were employed towards this end. The resulted
dataset comprises the maximum number of compatible datasets, i.e.,
datasets with matching temporal and spatial characteristics. In
particular, the data include 60 statistical indicators from seven
categories such as health and social care, housing, and crime and
justice. The indicators refer to the 6,976 ``2011 data zones{''} of
Scotland, while the year of reference is 2015. Data are ready to be used
by the research community, students, policy makers, and journalists and
give rise to plenty of social, business, and research scenarios that can
be solved using Machine Learning technologies and methods. (c) 2022 The

    abstract = {As a field of practice and research that is fast-growing and a locus for much attention and activity, open government data (OGD) has attracted stakeholders from a variety of origins. They bring with them a variety of meanings for OGD. The purpose of this paper is to show how the different stakeholders and their different perspectives on OGD can be analyzed in a given context. Taking Chile as an OGD exemplar, stakeholder analysis is used to identify and categorize stakeholder groups in terms of their relative power and interest as either primary (in this case, politicians, public officials, public sector practitioners, international organizations) or secondary (civil society activists, funding donors, ICT providers, academics). Stakeholder groups sometimes associated with OGD but absent from significant involvement in Chile – such as private sector- and citizen-users – are also identified. Four different perspectives on open government data – bureaucratic, political, technological, and economic – are identified from a literature review. Template analysis is used to analyze text – OGD-related reports, conference presentations, and interviews in Chile – in terms of those perspectives. This shows bureaucratic and political perspectives to be more dominant than the other two, and also some presence for a politico-economic perspective not identified from the original literature review. The information value chain is used to identify a “missing middle” in current Chilean OGD perspectives: a lack of connection between a reality of data provision and an aspiration of developmental results. This pattern of perspectives can be explained by the capacities and interests of key stakeholders, with those in turn being shaped by Chile's history, politics, and institutions. Overall, stakeholder analysis and perspectives analysis are shown from this case to be workable techniques for OGD that add value by exposing the identity, power, motivations, and worldview of key actors. They provide a necessary foundation of knowledge for both researchers and practitioners who need to understand the different meanings of OGD in any particular context. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

    abstract = {AI solutions can significantly leverage open government data (OGD) ecosystems in public governance. For that, it is important to design effective and transparent governance mechanisms that create value in an OGD ecosystem through AI solutions. This article develops a conceptual model for a systematic design of an OGD governance model, which adopts a platform governance approach and integrates the governance needs derived from the use of AI. The purpose of the conceptual model is to systematically identify and analyze the interrelationships among multiple change factors on OGD governance design and to project available AI-based solutions for the OGD ecosystem by assessing the managerial, organizational, legal, technological, moral, and institutional variances. The proposed ‘6-step model’ suggests that an AI-compatible OGD ecosystem design requires (i) identifying contingencies, (ii) identifying data prosumers, (iii) assigning data governance roles, (iv) identifying design values, (v) designing the governance of AI, and (vi) designing the governance by AI. Through the recursive and reflexive analysis of each step, policymakers and system designers can develop reliable strategies in leveraging AI solutions for the use of OGD in public governance. © 2023 – IOS Press.

    abstract = {A number of countries are today implementing open government data (OGD) initiatives. Yet many of these initiatives are failing to attract the levels of continuous use they need to deliver an acceptable return on investment. This raises the obvious question of why this should be the case. To answer this question, it is important to understand the factors that most strongly influence user behaviour in OGD adoption. Qualitative data were used to identify the factors that play a key role in influencing the intention to engage with ODG. A quantitative approach was then used to evaluate the extent to which these factors drive/limit behaviour. The study’s findings showed that there are four factors that play a significant role in intention to use OGD. It is also believed that the findings will be useful in helping policymakers in all jurisdictions formulate and implement strategies that successfully drive up continuous OGD engagement. © 2023 IGI Global.

    abstract = {Open government data (OGD) has been introduced relatively recently in Gulf Cooperation Council Countries (GCC Countries). However, progress has been significantly less than either hoped for or expected. The purpose of this research is to explore the reasons for this lack of progress. To do so, the attitudes and views of a range of senior government department (OGD-related) personnel were sought, using semi-structured interviews, and the results examined using thematic analysis. Unlike existing studies, which focus on external barriers to progress, this study focuses on internal factors which can result in a lack of progress to implementation, such as leadership attitudes, organisational culture and fear of failure. The findings show that considerable changes are required at both an ideological and practical level, if the gap between expectation and reality is to be closed. The paper concludes with recommendations of specific actions that can be taken to close this gap and the identification of areas where further study would be useful. © 2022 by the authors.

More than a decade of these efforts has provided much experience, practices, and perspectives to learn how to better deal with them. This paper focuses on benchmarking of open data initiatives over the years and attempts to identify patterns observed among European countries that could lead to disparities in the development, growth, and sustainability of open data ecosystems. To do this, we studied benchmarks and indices published over the last years (57 editions of 8 artifacts) and conducted a comparative case study of eight European countries, identifying patterns among them considering different potentially relevant contexts such as e-government, open government data, open data indices and rankings, and others relevant for the country under consideration. Using a Delphi method, we reached a consensus within a panel of experts and validated a final list of 94 patterns, including their frequency of occurrence among studied countries and their effects on the respective countries. Finally, we took a closer look at the developments in identified contexts over the years and defined 21 recommendations for more resilient and sustainable open government data initiatives and ecosystems and future steps in this area. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

    abstract = {Traffic forecasting has been an important area of research for several decades, with significant implications for urban traffic planning, management, and control. In recent years, deep-learning models, such as graph neural networks (GNN), have shown great promise in traffic forecasting due to their ability to capture complex spatio–temporal dependencies within traffic networks. Additionally, public authorities around the world have started providing real-time traffic data as open-government data (OGD). This large volume of dynamic and high-value data can open new avenues for creating innovative algorithms, services, and applications. In this paper, we investigate the use of traffic OGD with advanced deep-learning algorithms. Specifically, we deploy two GNN models—the Temporal Graph Convolutional Network and Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network—to predict traffic flow based on real-time traffic OGD. Our evaluation of the forecasting models shows that both GNN models outperform the two baseline models—Historical Average and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average—in terms of prediction performance. We anticipate that the exploitation of OGD in deep-learning scenarios will contribute to the development of more robust and reliable traffic-forecasting algorithms, as well as provide innovative and efficient public services for citizens and businesses. © 2023 by the authors.},

    abstract = {In this paper we focus on the emerging phenomenon of Open Government Data Platforms (OGDPs), in particular those that provide open performance data to general public. Governments world-wide continue to implement these platforms, aiming to increase transparency and accountability. However, in spite of their positive intentions, ODGPs that provide performance data (e.g. about schools or hospitals) are reported to create serious harmful social effects. While the related literature has reported numerous cases of these unintended effects, the questions regarding why and how they emerge remain open. This is not surprising, given the complexity and dynamics of processes instigated through the use of ODGPs by a very large number of known and unknowable actors. Through a diffractive reading of complexity theories, in particular Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) and sociomateriality, in this paper we propose a Complex Adaptive Sociomaterial Systems (CASS) theorization of OGDPs. Drawing from a case of OGDP in Australia called My School, which provides open performance data for more than 10.000 schools, we demonstrate how the proposed theoretical lens of CASS enables us to reveal and explain why and how these platforms perform unintended, yet serious social harm. Given that OGDPs are rapidly emerging around the world, our research opens a pathway for a research-informed public discourse about their harmful effects and responsibilities of different stakeholders. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Saudi Arabia launched its first open data initiative in 2011, with the goal of maximizing the economic impact of open data locally. This empirical study aimed to assess the effects of the Saudi OGD initiative by conducting a literature review and monitoring the impact of Saudi state-of-the-art open data. After observation and analysis, a systematic Monitor, Analysis, Action, and Review (MAAR) approach was followed to conduct a proposed solution that addresses quality shortcomings that consequently affect open data reusability. The methodology for creating the proposed solution included selecting, formulating, and weighing the quality characteristics that define a valuable OGD. The proposed solution is a framework for assessing the OGD quality using metrics that are compatible with the Saudi Open Data Portal (od.data.gov.sa). To review this proposed quality assessment framework and test whether it achieved its predicted outcomes, the results of the proposed solution were evaluated using local data samples from the Saudi Open Data Portal.  © 2013 IEEE.},

    abstract = {Open government data (OGD) provide an opportunity for developing various services by disclosing information monopolized by the government to the public so that the private sector can use it. The private sector is utilizing this to improve the work efficiency and productivity by collecting, analyzing, and reprocessing OGD for various work steps of a BIM-based design project. However, most studies on OGD focus on the functionality and usability of data portals and the factors for evaluating the data itself such as openness, accountability, and transparency. This study aims to provide an evaluation framework for OGD for the AEC industry to assess the data utilization environment in order to improve the productivity of BIM-based projects. Several OGD principles found within related literature are discussed, and from them we extract evaluation framework levels. Then, we validate the proposed framework by applying it to a case of developing a BIM-based design support system using OGD datasets. This research concludes by suggesting that to effectively utilize OGD in the construction industry, the private sector should simply view data after collecting them, create an institutional environment for creating new values by reprocessing data, and build an active data utilization roadmap based on this environment. © 2022 by the authors.

A multi-layered model of “open data - data utilization - data value creation”, aiming to reveal the synergistic evolution mechanisms between the three levels was proposed. The results show that: (1) From 2012 to 2021, a synergistic evolution mechanism occurs between the data-opening layer and the value-creating layer, with value generation as the order parameter. (2) From 2022 to 2035, there may be a shift in the dominance of the order parameter between the data-opening layer and the value-creating layer, and a new synergistic evolution mechanism between the data-opening layer and the data-utilizing layer might be generated. Therefore, the establishment of a synergistic evolution mechanism between the data-utilizing layer and the value-creating layer has the potential to increase the benefits of OGD ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

The aim of this study is to illustrate the use of open government data in estimating personal income levels for all 3181 municipalities, towns, and communes in Romania. The novelty of our work comes from the high granularity of the estimates obtained. We use tax revenues collected by local governments in Romania on vehicles and buildings owned by natural persons, as well as data on energy subsidies. The classification is conducted using the k-means clustering algorithm. We find three distinct clusters of communities, which we map. The results can benefit both businesses and policymakers. The former can use the income level estimates for market intelligence purposes, while for the latter, these may aid in determining the financial sustainability of local governments and a better allocation of central government resources at the subnational level. © 2019 by the authors.},

Bibliometric analysis, comparative analysis, cluster analysis, and principal component analysis (PCA) were the methods used in this research. From the comparative analysis, 18 indicators were identified as conforming and 41 as partially conforming. Thus, 20% of the ObservaSampa indicators adhere to the ISO standards. The PCA applied to the conforming indicators shows component 1 is related to socioeconomic dimensions, while component 2 refers to social policy, with both appraisals confirmed by cluster analysis. Measuring and presenting city data in compliance with indicator standards is relevant because they open the possibility of comparing different cities. However, there is still a lack of consensus on a common set of indicators to be accommodated within the current ISO standards system. © 2022 by the authors.},

To identify the underlying values and multiple purposes of OGD, we propose a Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) study, which aims to show how OGD has been forged and how the expectations towards it have evolved. This paper aims to contribute to the existing literature, offering a critical perspective of the OECD's work on OGD, as well as developing a more nuanced understanding of OGD's conceptual features. Finally, the study reveals the emergence of a data-driven government model, paving the way for further research on its effects on Public Administration and Public Law. © 2021 The Authors.

Thirty-two expert interviews and document analysis were used to research OGD implementation practices. The results reveal that OGD implementation as such is not enough to ensure the sustainability and success of OGD adoption in a country. Five different dimensions should be distinguished: policy and strategy, legislative foundations, organizational arrangements, relevant skills, public support and awareness. The approach to the institutional dimensions differs between the countries. Centralized OGD governance is shown to yield better results and a higher level of OGD implementation. The contribution of the present study is twofold: first, the article introduces institutional dimensions for explaining OGD implementation; second, it presents a comparative analysis of best practices in the three developed countries. © 2018, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © 2018, © 2018 Igbal Safarov.},

Although this relationship is intuitively apparent, it is in fact complex and the mere opening of data might not actually yield transparency. In this paper, a comprehensive model of determinants that enable or impede transparency enabled by open government data and the expected effects have been derived by surveying public administration and information systems literature. Public administration literature tends to be focused on factors such as participation and trust, whereas information systems literature focuses on factors such as user interface, user experience, and data quality. Digital government literature attempts to bridge these elements. The Window Theory is introduced, in order to unify existing models by integrating a broad range of factors within a single model. The Window Theory can be used to develop context-dependent models that are both comprehensive and parsimonious. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s). Pulished with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The present study focuses on two of the most prominent leadership styles: transformational and transactional. Drawing on the Organizational Commitment Theory, we claim that affective and normative commitment are the two parallel mechanisms that explain how leadership promotes OGD-driven innovation in firms. Our results show that transformational leadership promotes OGD-driven radical innovation through affective commitment. In contrast, transactional leadership promotes OGD-driven incremental innovation through normative commitment. More importantly, we suggest that the OGD application stage moderates the effect of leadership on organizational commitment. Specifically, in the initial stage of the OGD application, higher transformational leadership triggers higher affective commitment in employees. In contrast, in the mature stage of OGD application, higher transactional leadership triggers higher normative commitment in employees. © 2023 by the authors.},

Despite the anti-market and anti-corporation values around free sharing, citizen participation, and unrestricted transparency propagated in particular by a highly idealized academic discourse on OGD, our case study of the development of Switzerland's national OGD portal suggests that the altruistic and philanthropic notion that is often associated with OGD needs to be reconsidered. We show that low use, on one side, and the practical necessity towards cost-recovery behaviors, on the other side, have led to a compromise of the altruistic ideological beginnings of OGD and paved the way for a pragmatic shift towards a more utilitarian, partly even protectionist, view on liberating and sharing data.  © 2023 - The authors.

However, these OGD portals are mostly developed for expert users. This hinders the realization of critical values such as transparency, empowerment, and equality of access. Following a Design Science Research approach, this study aims to examine how gamification can help tailor OGD portals for lay citizens. As a pre-condition to this goal, we identify requirements toward OGD portals through twenty interviews with experts and lay citizens. Compared to expert users, lay citizens expect an OGD portal with a more playful interface, vulgarized content, customized visualizations, and transparency-related datasets in a human-readable format. Second, we develop our research artifact, the OGD portal prototype, implementing fifteen design propositions using gamification theory to address lay citizens’ requirements. Third, the evaluation with ten lay citizens reveals the perceived usefulness of the design propositions. Badges were evaluated as most useful to highlight portal relevance. This study contributes to OGD theory development by identifying lay citizens' requirements towards OGD use. Furthermore, this study is the first to reveal the usefulness of implementing notions from gamification theory into OGD portal design. Finally, practitioners can use our findings to make OGD portals more inclusive and thus contribute to attaining key OGD policy objectives. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to develop a user process framework with activities and their variations for the use of open government data (OGD) based on empirical material and previous research. OGD is interoperable data that is shared by public organisations (publishers) for anyone (users) to reuse without restrictions to create new digital products and services. The user process was roughly identified in previous research but lacks an in-depth description. This lack can hamper the ability to encourage the use and the development of related theories. Design/methodology/approach: A three-stage research approach was used. First, a tentative framework was created from previous research and empirical material. This stage involved three different literature reviews, data mapping and seven interviews with OGD experts. The empirical material was analysed with inductive analysis, and previous research was integrated into the framework through concept mapping. Second, the tentative framework was reviewed by informed OGD experts. Third, the framework was finalised with additional literature reviews, eight interviews with OGD users, and a member check, including all the respondents. The framework was used to guide the data collection and as a tool in the analysis. Findings: The user process framework covers activities and related variations, where the included phases are: start, identify, acquire, enrich and deploy. The start varies relating to the intended use of the OGD. In the identify phase, the user is exploring the accessible data to decide if the data are relevant. In the acquire phase, the user is preparing for the delivery of the data from the publisher and receiving it. In the enrich phase, the user is concocting and making something. In the final deploy phase, the user has a product or service that can be provided to end-users. Research limitations/implications: The framework development has some limitations: the framework needs testing and development in different contexts and further verification. The implications are that the framework can help guide researchers towards relevant and essential data of the user process, be used as a point of comparison in analysis, and be used as a skeleton for more precious theories. Practical implications: The framework has some practical implications for users, publishers and portals. It can introduce users to the user process and help them plan for the execution of it. The framework can help publishers understand how the users can work with their data and what can be expected of them. The framework can help portal owners to understand the portal’s role between users and publishers and what functionality and features they can provide to support to the user. Originality/value: In previous research, no user process with an in-depth description was identified. However, several studies have given a rough recall. Thus, this research provides an in-depth description of the user process with its variations. The framework can support practice and leads to new research avenues. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Open data is a global movement with the potential to generate significant social and economic benefits. Policies on open government data (OGD) inspire the development of new and innovative services that government agencies may lack. The International Open Data Charter adequately describes the importance of data mining. Governments that have signed this charter should focus on the following areas—(i) data mining, (ii) linkage, and (iii) in-depth analysis, i.e., distribution of open data that is freely accessible for elaborate analysis using machine reading. However, a series of practical difficulties is observed in connection with the data mining of OGD for in-depth analysis. First, most OGD do not have identifiers to prevent privacy disclosure. Second, owing to the nature of siloed data, the data sharing and collection methods vary with respect to heterogeneous OGD, and administrative or institutional barriers need to be overcome. This has created a demand for a novel technical solution that applies micro-aggregation and distance-based record linkage to address the aforementioned issues. Thus, in this study, a method capable of integrating two or more de-identified OGDs into one dataset to enable OGD data mining is proposed. In addition, the proposed method allows users to adjust the privacy threshold level to determine an appropriate balance between privacy disclosure risk and data utility. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated in terms of several metrics via extensive experimentation. This study emphasizes the importance of the research on efficient utilization of already-published OGDs, which has been relatively neglected in the past. Further, it broadens the research area for privacy-preserving data mining by proposing a method capable of mining heterogeneous data even in the absence of identifiers. © 2020 The Author(s)},

    abstract = {Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and Electronic Health Records (EHR) are
often missing critical information about the death of a patient,
although it is an essential metric for medical research in oncology to
assess survival outcomes, particularly for evaluating the efficacy of
new therapeutic approaches. We used open government data in France from
1970 to September 2021 to identify deceased patients and match them with
patient data collected from the Institut de Cancerologie de l'Ouest
(ICO) data warehouse (Integrated Center of Oncology-the third largest
cancer center in France) between January 2015 and November 2021. To meet
our objective, we evaluated algorithms to perform a deterministic record
linkage: an exact matching algorithm and a fuzzy matching algorithm.
Because we lacked reference data, we needed to assess the algorithms by
estimating the number of homonyms that could lead to false links, using
the same open dataset of deceased persons in France. The exact matching
algorithm allowed us to double the number of dates of death in the ICO
data warehouse, and the fuzzy matching algorithm tripled it. Studying
homonyms assured us that there was a low risk of misidentification, with
precision values of 99.96\% for the exact matching and 99.68\% for the
fuzzy matching. However, estimating the number of false negatives proved
more difficult than anticipated. Nevertheless, using open government
data can be a highly interesting way to improve the completeness of the
date of death variable for oncology patients in data warehouses},

    abstract = {Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives promise to make governments transparent, enabling citizens to participate actively in governance. Yet, empirical evidence suggests that OGD doesn't have the democratic impact that its advocates expect. Based on a 14-month ethnography of India's livelihood program, we argue that the assumptions underlying the design of OGD initiatives vary with citizens' social context. We show how OGD initiatives are state-centric in their design to make the functioning of the everyday state legible towards controlling corruption. However, citizens and social activists do not always share such an 'anti-corruption' view in their engagement with the everyday state. Instead, they prioritise 'getting things done', i.e. accessing the state's services. The state-centric OGD is of limited value to them due to its techno-official language and its emphasis on aggregate datasets. We suggest complementing state-centric OGD with citizen-centric OGD to enable the citizens to 'see the state'.  © 2023 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

It is composed of a number of dimensions that can be measured to understand issues possibly arising in the implementation of a policy or of a project targeting a community. Measuring these dimensions is thus highly valuable for policymakers and local administrator, though expensive and time consuming. To address this issue, we evaluated their estimation through a machine learning technique—Random Forests—applied to secondary open government data and determined the most important variables for prediction. We focused on two dimensions: sense of community and participation. The variables included in the data sets used to train the predictive models complied with two criteria: nationwide availability and sufficiently fine-grained geographic breakdown, that is, neighborhood level. Our resultant models are more accurate than others based on traditional statistics found in the literature, showing the feasibility of the approach. The most determinant variables in our models were only partially in agreement with the most influential factors for sense of community and participation according to the social science literature consulted, providing a starting point for future investigation under a social science perspective. Moreover, due to the lack of geographic detail of the outcome measures available, further research is required to apply the predictive models to a neighborhood level. © 2017 Policy Studies Organization},

    abstract = {Open government data (OGD) has gained much attention worldwide; however, there is still an increasing demand for exploring research from the perspective of its adoption and diffusion. Policymakers expect that OGD will be used on a large scale by the public, which will result in a range of benefits, such as: faith and trust in governments, innovation and development, and partic-ipatory governance. However, not much is known about which factors influence the citizens’ intention to use OGD. Therefore, this research aims at empirically investigating the factors that influence citizens’ intention to use OGD in a developing country using information systems theory. Improved knowledge and understanding of the influencing factors can assist policymakers in determining which policy initiatives they can take to increase the intention to widely use OGD. Upon conducting a survey and performing analysis, findings reveal that perceived usefulness, social approval, and enjoyment positively influences intention, whereas voluntariness of use negatively influences OGD use. Further, perceived usefulness is significantly affected by perceived ease of use, and OGD use is significantly affected by OGD use intention. However, surprisingly, the intention to use OGD is not significantly affected by perceived ease of use. The policymakers suggest increasing the intention to use OGD by considering significant factors. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

    abstract = {Open government data (OGD) platform ecosystems hold immense potential for promoting transparency, civic engagement, economic growth, and improved governmental offerings. The prevailing strategy to building OGD platform ecosystems follows a sequential approach where the OGD platform is built first and the ecosystem is built second, resulting in low engagement. In this paper, we derive insights into an alternative approach to developing OGD platform ecosystems from TourismData, a state-owned tourism initiative in Germany. We report on the phases between 2018 and 2022 and derive four dynamic and incremental phases from which we derive three learnings: context specificity, continuous adaptation, and organic expansion. Our findings have theoretical and practical implications for developing high-engagement OGD platform ecosystems that include and engage ecosystem actors from the start and, hence, take advantage of the generative potential of OGD. This approach illustrates the importance of developing OGD platform ecosystems with high contextual relevance to ensure that data can be used to enable meaningful interactions between ecosystem actors and promote continuous adaptation and expansion. © 2023 The Authors},

    abstract = {Purpose: It has been underscored in the extant literature that open government data (OGD) has not percolated across the length and breadth of any country, let alone the awareness of the OGD among the stakeholders themselves. In this vein, this study aims to underline the reasons as to why OGD promotion merits consideration apart from underlining the manner in which OGD promotion may be done. Design/methodology/approach: Based on literature review on the OGD conceptual models and government promotion initiatives, the study further sketches an OGD model across four quadrants: beginners, followers, fast-trackers, trend-setters on the basis of the progress made in their OGD initiatives besides underlining the four elements of OGD promotional strategy as media, arena, substance and stakeholders. Also, the study explores the drivers and barriers to OGD promotional initiatives. Findings: The study shows that across the OGD quadrants, the promotional strategies vary in terms of the 4As (acceptability, affordability, accessibility and awareness), and the same get reflected across MASS. Further, the drivers for OGD promotional initiatives are building citizens’ trust and forging stakeholder participation and collaboration in administration, thereby furthering transparency in administration, meeting the needs of the stakeholders, providing the desired impetus to value creation and innovation by the stakeholders and the need for furthering economic growth. Likewise, the barriers toward OGD promotion are linked with the lack of political will, lack of organizational leadership, mission and vision, lack of involvement of government departments, lack of budget and lack of requisite infrastructure for promotion. Originality/value: Hitherto, OGD research has underscored the need to make the users aware of the potential of OGD initiative; however, no study has been undertaken to understand the manner in which the awareness may be driven among the users – the present study is a first step in this direction. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

agency would be releasing a significant volume of data as part of its
Open Data policy agenda. This article explores the interrelationship
between this announcement and efforts to boost the competitiveness of
the United Kingdom's weather derivatives industry. Primary qualitative
data are analyzed to produce a genealogical account of these policy
developments, and Braman's concept of informational power is used to
frame a critical narrative of the broader dynamics of power at play. We
argue that although there have been significant tensions around efforts
to open the United Kingdom's weather data, these have largely been
absorbed by and, ultimately, contained within the hegemonic structures
of the United Kingdom's neoliberal state. We conclude by arguing that
this struggle needs to be broadened and externalized beyond the state so
that critical questions about the deepening data-driven financialization
of climate change can be addressed.},

    abstract = {Purpose: This study investigates the individual and binary (i.e. combined) effects of institutional dimensions of open government data (which include instructional, structural and accessible rules) on scientific research innovation, as well as the mediating roles that researchers' perceived data usefulness and data capability play in between. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 1,092 respondents, this study uses partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and polynomial regression with response surface analysis to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of individual and binary institutional dimensions on scientific research innovation. Findings: The findings demonstrate that instructional, structural and restricted access data have a positive effect on scientific research innovation in the individual effect. While the binary effect of institutional dimensions produces varying degrees of scientific research innovation. Furthermore, this study discovers that the perceived usefulness and data capability of researchers differ in the mediating effect of institutional dimensions on scientific research innovation. Originality/value: Theoretically, this study contributes new knowledge on the causal links between data publication institutions and innovation. Practically, the research findings offer government data managers timely suggestions on how to build up institutions to foster greater data usage. © 2024, Rui Mu and Xiaxia Zhao.},

As a result of our holistic analysis, we identify and discuss current trends and challenges in the development and evaluation of chatbots in the public administration sector, such as focusing the use of the conversational agents on the search for government information, documents and services –leaving citizen consultation and collaboration aside–, and conducting preliminary evaluations of prototypes in limited studies, lacking experiments on deployed systems, with metrics beyond effectiveness and usability –e.g., metrics related to the generation of public values. Addressing some of the identified challenges, we build and evaluate two novel chatbots that present advances in the access to open government data and citizen participation content. Moreover, we come up with additional, potential research lines that may be considered in the future for a new generation of e-government chatbots. © 2023 The Authors},

    abstract = {Today, the concepts of the smart city and smart government are well established, and have become key in dealing with the challenges faced by rapidly increasing urbanisation across the world. One of the many ways in which smart cities and government can help meet these challenges is by empowering citizens to take more and better control of their own decisions, by giving them access to open (i.e., public and unrestricted) data via online portals. These portals can enable citizens and professionals to make more informed decisions across a wide variety of areas, from health and traffic issues to developing new businesses. They can also encourage citizens to become more involved in the making of more effective social policy. Open data is increasingly seen as a key enabler in designing and implementing knowledge-based solutions for more sustainable urban development. For these reasons, as well as others, OGD (Open Government Data) portals are already being implemented in many countries. However, if smart cities are to maximise their potential, OGD portals must be understood, accepted and—crucially—used by the public. The extent to which this is the case is not clear, as there have been few studies that have specifically examined the impact of open data in a smart city context. This is particularly true in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries. This research uses a mixed methods (questionnaires and interviews) approach to examine this issue by carrying out a comparative study of the use of portals across the region and, therefore, whether these countries are making optimum use of open data. An existing evaluation framework was used with a group of evaluators representing professional users who are not experienced in using data portals. The findings of the research suggest that these countries are not yet realising the full potential of their portals, and more effective support for the transition to smart cities could be achieved with fuller and better cross-national cooperation. © 2023 by the authors.},

The ability of these portals to deliver the expected benefits depends on their usability and accessibility, besides their content. This study conducts an integrated assessment and comparison of the OGD portals of 75 countries based on their usability and accessibility. The usability of the portals is measured through several technical indicators, classified into performance metrics, browser timings, and optimisation using automated diagnostic tools. Accessibility is evaluated through portals’ conformance to web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG). The ‘technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution’ (TOPSIS) and entropy weight method are used to rank the portals. The findings of this study could be helpful for policymakers and internal stakeholders of OGD initiatives to identify the focus area and make decisions on resource allocation. © 2023 IGI Global.

Design/methodology/approach: The developed methodology consisted of a two-step strategy to investigate research questions. First, a web content analysis was conducted to identify the most common features and capabilities provided by existing national open data portals. The second step involved performing the Delphi process by surveying domain experts to measure the diversity of their opinions on this topic. Findings: Identified features and capabilities were classified into categories and ranked according to their importance. By formalizing these feature-related transparency mechanisms through which stakeholders work with data sets we provided recommendations on how to incorporate them into designing and developing open data portals. Social implications: The creation of appropriate open data portals aims to fulfil the principles of open government and enables stakeholders to effectively engage in the policy and decision-making processes. Originality/value: By analyzing existing national open data portals and validating the feature-related transparency mechanisms, this paper fills this gap in existing literature on designing and developing open data portals for transparency efforts. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study is contextualized in Tanzania wherein the OGD initiatives are at an evolving stage. For the present study, the perspectives of the 15 public officials involved in the management of the OGD initiatives are being solicited. Findings underscore the need for furthering the marketing and refurbishing the OGD initiatives' quality alongside the increased involvement of the stakeholders to engage in value co-creation. Furthermore, as a study contextualized in a developing country to understand the involvement of the public personnel in the refurbishment of the OGD initiatives, the study contributes to the extant OGD literature while identifying the OGD publisher-side challenges and strengths in a still-evolving OGD initiative. Finally, with its societal implications in terms of the impact on societal stakeholders' engagement with OGD given the PSL-PSM of the public officials, the study's relevance is also clinched. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

This study investigated the impact of open government data (OGD) on the urban–rural income divide in China. Our theoretical analysis shows that the nonrival nature of data initially widens the urban–rural income divide before eventually mitigating it, resulting in an inverted U-shaped relationship. Using a multiperiod difference-in-differences specification, we found that OGD widened the urban–rural income divide between 2010 and 2019. Furthermore, cities with initially wider urban–rural income divides experienced a greater impact from OGD in expanding this divide. These findings provide valuable insights in the role of open data in addressing income inequality, and contribute to our understanding of data inequalities in the context of the data revolution. © 2023 by the authors.},

Thus, during the past few years, governments around the world have been under increasing pressure to release data to encourage citizen participation in government. In the UK, the government publishes its data on the data.gov.uk website for the public to find, view, download and interrogate. In this paper, we evaluate the extent of openness of OGD in the UK – a recognised global leader in the OGD movement – by examining a sample of 400 datasets listed on this website. The examination uses an ‘ordinary citizen’ test, which is developed based on the original eight Sebastopol principles of open data. Our examination discovers that existing prevalent measures of openness of data are inadequate. Our findings demonstrate that the majority of the published government resources on the website are informational rather than granular data. In fact, only a small minority of these advertised as open data are actually open, which severely limits their open government utilities. © 2019},

It is important to understand what value they create and how, and at the same time – since this is a relatively new type of information systems (IS) – to identify the main improvements they require. This paper contributes in this direction by presenting a methodology for determining the value generation mechanism of open government data (OGD) systems and also priorities for their improvement. It is based on the estimation of a ‗value model‘of the OGD system under evaluation from users‘ratings, which consists of several value dimensions and their corresponding value measures, organized in three ‘value layers‘, and also the relations among them. The proposed methodology has been successfully applied to an OGD system developed as part of the European project ENGAGE (‘An Infrastructure for Open, Linked Governmental Data Provision towards Research Communities and Citizens‘), and provided interesting insights and improvement priorities. This first application provides evidence that our methodology can be a useful decision support tool for important ODG systems investment, management and improvement decisions. © 2016, ComSIS Consortium.

    abstract = {The business intelligence (BI) market has grown at a tremendous rate in the past decade due to technological advancements, big data and the availability of open source content. Despite this growth, the use of open government data (OGD) as a source of information is very limited among the private sector due to a lack of knowledge as to its benefits. Scant evidence on the use of OGD by private organizations suggests that it can lead to the creation of innovative ideas as well as assist in making better informed decisions. Given the benefits but lack of use of OGD to generate business intelligence, we extend research in this area by exploring how OGD can be used to generate business intelligence for the identification of market opportunities and strategy formulation; an area of research that is still in its infancy. Using a two-industry case study approach (footwear and lumber), we use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling to extract emerging topics in these two industries from OGD, and a data visualization tool (pyLDAVis) to visualize the topics in order to interpret and transform the data into business intelligence. Additionally, we perform an environmental scanning of the environment for the two industries to validate the usability of the information obtained. The results provide evidence that OGD can be a valuable source of information for generating business intelligence and demonstrate how topic modeling and visualization tools can assist organizations in extracting and analyzing information for the identification of market opportunities. © 2021 by the authors.

    abstract = {In order to improve legitimacy, accountability and effectiveness for both policy making and service delivery, governance networks can benefit from the knowledge, skills and other key resources of external actors. However, these networks are often prone to social and cognitive exclusion of outsiders, reducing the potential benefits of greater inclusiveness and diversity. Inclusiveness within governance networks is defined here as the possibility for new actors to both enter the network and to influence its decisions. Based on an extensive literature review, this paper argues that Open Government Data (OGD) strategies and related technologies can potentially contribute to governance network management strategies aimed at preventing social and cognitive exclusion. We propose a conceptual model of how these relationships work. However, empirical evidence from the literature included very few cases in which the positive effect of OGD strategies has actually been achieved. Therefore, we also identify two critical success factors that appear to be needed: (1) proactive data strategies to expand the network of interested parties and their ability to use data, and (2) empowering new interested actors by promoting their access to structural and formal roles in the network and systematically integrating their feedback into the policy cycle.  © 2022 - IOS Press.

    abstract = {Information disclosure, participatory governance, and collaborative innovation are open government data’s (OGD) main goals. Understanding the preconditions that enable the efficient and effective implementation of OGD initiatives is essential for achieving their overall objectives. Therefore, determining its influencing factors helps improve platform quality, prevent misunderstanding, and realize the purpose of OGD. Based on the literature, this study established a user-oriented conceptual model of OGD into which technology acceptance theory was integrated. This model constructed a data analysis model with the number of downloads of OGD platform data as the response variable and the explanatory variables comprising OGD quality score, linked data density, time to inception, and five others. Sixty-one cases of OGD platforms in Chinese prefecture-level cities were analyzed. The results indicated that the effectiveness of OGD was positively correlated with OGD quality score, time to inception, and the number of employees in the case cities. Network density and average disposable income of citizens had non-significant impacts on effectiveness. Strategies for improving the effectiveness of OGD platforms in China were discussed. © The Author(s) 2023.},

    abstract = {Public administrations handle large amounts of data in relation to their internal processes as well as to the services that they offer. Following public-sector information reuse regulations and worldwide open data publication trends, these administrations are increasingly publishing their data as open data. However, open data are often released without agreed data models and in non-reusable formats, reducing interoperability and efficiency in data reuse. These aspects hinder interoperability with other administrations and do not allow taking advantage of the associated knowledge in an efficient manner. This paper presents the continued work performed by the Zaragoza city council over more than 15 years in order to generate its knowledge graph, which constitutes the key piece of their data management system, whose main strengthen is the open-data-by-default policy. The main functionalities that have been developed for the internal and external exploitation of the city's open data are also presented. Finally, some city council experiences and lessons learned during this process are also explained. © 2020 by the authors.},

into barriers to open geographic data reuse from a data consumer's
perspective. This article suggests a taxonomy of these barriers for
Colombia and Spain, based on a literature review, an online
questionnaire, and workshops conducted in four cities of these two
countries. The taxonomy highlights that issues such as outdated data,
low integration of data producers, published data being difficult to
access, misinterpretation and misuse of released data and their terms of
use are the most relevant from the data consumer's point of view. The
article ends with some recommendations to open data providers and

momentum in recent years and refers to data from various domains, with
particular emphasis on those arising from governmental activities and
those produced in research. Authors have alerted to the problem of lack
of skills among users and the general public for effective use of open
data. Seeking to understand what the literature says about Information
Literacy in practices involving open data, a systematic literature
review was conducted, covering interdisciplinary perspectives, utilizing
the Web of Science database for data collection. Two main research
trends were identified: one investigating open data as a pedagogical
element in educational research; and the other discussing the skills
associated with practices involving Open Data. This work presents an
analysis of articles comprising the second group. Since the description
of the skills necessary for the use of Open Data is not consolidated in
the literature, this study contributes to the understanding of
competence in Open Data in various contexts.},

    abstract = {Open government data (OGD) is believed to enhance democratic outcomes by empowering citizens with the information necessary to participate in meaningful ways. Nonetheless, questions remain about whether OGD is indeed empowering citizens to participate or if the data that governments publish is more reflective of the interests of non-citizen stakeholders. Using the metadata of 2607 publicly available datasets scraped from New York City's open data portal, this exploratory study uses qualitative content analysis to identify what types of data are published and what the data say about OGD's potential as a tool for advancing inclusion in democratic processes. The analysis focused particularly on the datasets' relevance to five particular stakeholder groups: citizens, private sector firms, nonprofits, researchers, and the city's internal agencies. Findings showed that non-citizen-relevant datasets not only outnumbered citizen-relevant datasets by a large margin but they were also viewed and downloaded at higher rates too. The implications of this for inclusion in democratic processes are discussed, including power imbalances among OGD user groups, the discretionary power data publishers possess, and, ultimately, whether the types of data cities publish is sufficient for empowering an informed citizenry, as an effective democracy demands.  © 2022 - IOS Press.},

    abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, open government data (OGD) was often used as a valuable crisis management resource. Unfortunately, there is limited research that explores how OGD can be used during times of crisis as a crisis management tool. To ensure that OGD can be used effectively in future crises, there is a need to understand how it may be used and what benefits its usage may bring. This paper brings new insight into this topic by conducting a comparative exploratory case study of three Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries - Czech Republic, Estonia and Latvia, where OGD was used at different levels to help manage different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of this research, three contributions are made: (1) it integrates OGD into previous crisis management literature, offering new and initial conceptual propositions; (2) it demonstrates how OGD enables the co-creation of new services that create public value during times of crisis; and (3) it provides empirical examples of OGD-driven co-created services.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

    abstract = {Open government data (OGD) has attracted widespread attention and has been widely carried out on a global scale. With further promotion, OGD performance becomes a hot topic and meaningful enough for in-depth exploration. This research focuses on the influential factors and generation mechanisms of OGD performance. Based on the resource-based theory and institutional theory, this paper constructs a model from multiple dimensions of internal resources and external pressures. Subsequently, from the 122 cities in China that have constructed OGD platforms, this study adopts a mixed research methods approach, which combines the regression analysis method and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). The regression analysis results show that the organization arrangement, legal and policy, and horizontal pressure have direct positive effects on OGD performance. On this basis, this paper use QCA method to explore the configuration paths for the generation of OGD performance of cities in different geographic regions and at different administrative ranks levels. The QCA results provide different configuration paths to achieve better OGD performance, which verified the conclusions drawn by the regression analysis, also provides alternative paths for governments with different characteristics. This paper enriches the studies on OGD performance and provides more targeted paths together with references for the implementation of OGD. © 2022 The Authors},

    abstract = {Open government data (OGD) have important political, economic, and social values that are highly valued by many countries around the world. These data represent the cross-boundary information sharing practices between governments and the public. Therefore, this paper investigates OGD by following the theory and practice of cross-boundary information sharing. Most of the current studies have focused on OGD platform, whereas this study has focused on individual government departments and datasets. From the perspective of public data users, we constructed an evaluation index to measure OGD quality, which reflected the degree of cross-boundary information sharing between the governments and the public. We specifically concentrated on the external environment of OGD and selected 128 government departments in Shanghai, Beijing, and Wuhan in China as samples. We found that institutional capacity is an important factor for OGD quality of individual government departments. However, technology capacity and organization arrangement demonstrated small significance for OGD quality. The pressure from the public and higher-level government departments can moderate the relationship between institutional capacity and OGD quality. These results can guide governments in prioritizing the improvement of OGD quality and implementing an OGD project. © 2017},

The objective of this work is to identify the level of openness of data in Brazilian government portals, map initiatives for the organization of information, and compliance with legislation. The clipping comprises the Brazilian government portals, specifically: two maintained by the Federal Government, one by the Government of the Federal District, and the Governments of the twenty-six Brazilian States. We used two instruments to evaluate the portals: the five-star rating scheme for open data and the fourteen principles for open government data. The methodology comprises documentary research, using instruments for analysis and evaluation of the clipping in a qualitative approach with a descriptive purpose. The results showed that only the Brazilian Open Data Portal reached the fourth star. As for the second instrument, the Federal Government and the states of Alagoas and Espírito Santo comply with the largest number of principles. States like Amazonas, Rio de Janeiro, and Paraná have the worst results. We have concluded that Brazilian government portals have a low supply of open data, rarely structured and machine-readable, without standardization or interoperability. © 2022, Universidade de Brasilia.

    abstract = {Purpose: Existing overviews of barriers for openly sharing and using government data are often conceptual or based on a limited number of cases. Furthermore, it is unclear what categories of barriers are most obstructive for attaining open data objectives. This paper aims to categorize and prioritize barriers for openly sharing and using government data based on many existing Open Government Data Initiatives (OGDIs). Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzes 171 survey responses concerning existing OGDIs worldwide. Findings: The authors found that the most critical OGDI barrier categories concern (in order of most to least critical): functionality and support; inclusiveness; economy, policy and process; data interpretation; data quality and resources; legislation and access; and sustainability. Policymakers should prioritize solving functionality and support barriers and inclusiveness barriers because the authors found that these are the most obstructive in attaining OGDI objectives. Practical implications: The prioritization of open data barriers calls for three main actions by practitioners to reduce the barrier impact: open data portal developers should develop advanced tools to support data search, analysis, visualization, interpretation and interaction; open data experts and teachers should train potential users, and especially those currently excluded from OGDIs because of a lack of digital skills; and government agencies that provide open data should put user-centered design and the user experience central to better support open data users. Originality/value: This study contributes to the open data literature by proposing a new, empirically based barrier categorization and prioritization based a large number of existing OGDIs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Purpose: Citizen engagement is key to the success of many Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives. However, not much is known regarding how this type of engagement emerges. This study aims to investigate the necessary conditions for the emergence of citizen-led engagement with OGD and to identify which factors stimulate this type of engagement. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors created a systematic overview of the literature to develop a conceptual model of conditions and factors of OGD citizen engagement at the societal, organizational and individual level. Second, the authors used the conceptual model to systematically study citizens’ engagement in the case of a particular OGD initiative, namely, the digitization of presidential election results data in Indonesia in 2014. The authors used multiple information sources, including interviews and documents, to explore the conditions and factors of OGD citizen-led engagement in this case. Findings: From the literature the authors identified five conditions for the emergence of OGD citizen-led engagement as follows: the availability of a legal and political framework that grants a mandate to open up government data, sufficient budgetary resources allocated for OGD provision, the availability of OGD feedback mechanisms, citizens’ perceived ease of engagement and motivated citizens. In the literature, the authors found six factors contributing to OGD engagement as follows: democratic culture, the availability of supporting institutional arrangements, the technical factors of OGD provision, the availability of citizens’ resources, the influence of social relationships and citizens’ perceived data quality. Some of these conditions and factors were found to be less important in the studied case, namely, citizens’ perceived ease of engagement and citizens’ perceived data quality. Moreover, the authors found several new conditions that were not mentioned in the studied literature, namely, citizens’ sense of urgency, competition among citizen-led OGD engagement initiatives, the diversity of citizens’ skills and capabilities and the intensive use of social media. The difference between the conditions and factors that played an important role in the case and those derived from the literature review might be because of the type of OGD engagement that the authors studied, namely, citizen-led engagement, without any government involvement. Research limitations/implications: The findings are derived using a single case study approach. Future research can investigate multiple cases and compare the conditions and factors for citizen-led engagement with OGD in different contexts. Practical implications: The conditions and factors for citizen-led engagement with OGD have been evaluated in practice and discussed with public managers and practitioners through interviews. Governmental organizations should prioritize and stimulate those conditions and factors that enhance OGD citizen engagement to create more value with OGD. Originality/value: While some research on government-led engagement with OGD exists, there is hardly any research on citizen-led engagement with OGD. This study is the first to develop a conceptual model of necessary conditions and factors for citizen engagement with OGD. Furthermore, the authors applied the developed multilevel conceptual model to a case study and gathered empirical evidence of OGD engagement and its contributions to solving societal problems, rather than staying at the conceptual level. This research can be used to investigate citizen engagement with OGD in other cases and offers possibilities for systematic cross-case lesson-drawing. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {The academic interest in the Open Government Data (OGD) domain has been
burgeoning over the years. Conceding that the prime focus of an OGD
initiative is its further re-use for value creation and innovation by
stakeholders, the present study seeks to underscore the role of HEXACO
personality traits on behavioral intention (BI) to adopt and use OGD in
developing countries' context. We investigate the direct, indirect, and
moderating effects of HEXACO personality traits provide a better
understanding of how and to what extent personality traits influence
future behavioral intention to use OGD. The results demonstrate that
Trust and Performance Expectancy are positive predictors of BI to adopt
and use OGD. Users with higher Openness to Experience tend to have
higher Effort and Performance Expectancy; are characterized by exposure
to Social Influence; have higher level of Trust and positive experience
of Facilitating Conditions and Information Quality. Agreeable people are
more likely to Voluntarily Use OGD. Conscientiousness enhances the
individual's perception of OGD quality-related factors. Excessive
Emotionality affects negative perception to System and Information
Quality issues. Honesty-Humility and Extraversion are able to maintain
the effect of OGD Information Quality and Trust on users' BI. Our
findings could be useful for practitioners to level the divergence
between actual and potential use of OGD by considering the user's
personality traits. .},

    abstract = {Institutional factors such as data standardization, data interoperability, and the ability to include other stakeholders (e.g., civil society) in ecosystems are now understood as crucial considerations in Open Government Data (OGD) implementation. However, most of the current understanding of institutional factors linked to OGD growth has evolved around highly digitalized and developed countries. This study aims to address this gap by investigating open data implementation in Indonesia, a developing country that has been an early advocate of OGD in the "Asia Pacific". In 2014, Indonesia implemented Satu Data Indonesia (One Data Indonesia) as a national initiative to promote OGD objectives. We employ institutional dimensions as the central theoretical lens to unpack the successes and impediments to Satu Data Indonesia’s development. This research dataset is built on 16 expert interviews from government (n = 14) and private (n = 2) organizations that directly contribute to the growth of Satu Data Indonesia, qualitatively triangulated with documentary analysis of key policy and regulatory documents. These new data provide important insights into the complexity and challenges of nationwide OGD implementation and data-sharing. Our findings show that despite its being an early advocate, Indonesia’s OGD initiative is still in the early stages of development, impeded by several policy and administrative bottlenecks. © 2024 The Author(s).

    abstract = {Purpose This study aims to investigate how, in forming their policy
towards open data (OD), art museums interact with the OD ecosystems they
are part of, comprising internal and external components such as
cultural policy, legal frameworks, user groups and economic conditions
and incentives. Design/methodology/approach The authors structure their
research as a multiple case study based on three OD ecosystems, each
defined by a mid-sized European art museum at its centre. Qualitative
analysis of the case studies proceeds from interviews with museum
management staff and policy-related agencies in three European
countries, in addition to document analysis. Findings The results of
this study suggest that museums are sensitive towards their environments
and respond to their ecosystem based on what is communicated within
their networks. However, museums are not effective in communicating with
their users, limiting the informational interdependence necessary for
well-functioning OD ecosystems. EU policy appears to be a driving force
along with national financial incentives, though institutional
conditions are limiting progress. Advancing the field relies instead on
an epistemological shift to understand the museum as part of a larger
information network. Originality/value As the first comparative case
study of art museum OD ecosystems that the authors are aware of, the
study provides a qualitative analysis of the complex dynamics impacting
OD policy within the mid-sized art museum. The authors identify specific
dynamics that are thus far restricting further development of the OD
ecosystem of the mid-sized European art museum.},

    abstract = {Managing geo-based indoor content is important, because the components
used to construct an urban environment are complex. Geospatial data are
available worldwide, but services are tailored only to local features.
As the accuracy of online maps increases, the buildings in a web-mapping
service can be created exactly as they are, in terms of actual features
and geometric properties, and can provide some information on indoor
elements. Nevertheless, not many practical use cases exist, as the
available scope and volume of indoor content are limited. In Korea's
metropolitan areas, an indoor geospatial information management scheme
was built to manage internal facility information for public and
underground buildings on a three-dimensional (3D) basis and to provide
online visualization services for users. Based on this enterprise system
for public use of indoor 3D content, we conducted a case study with
add-on features to manipulate and manage data by adding two-dimensional
(2D) building data that are linked to the 3D models. We also changed the
classification system of the points of interest (POIs) for each internal
facility. To enhance public usability, a portion of the usable
information in this scheme can be offered via an open application
programming interface (Open API). To create a 2D POIs obtained from an
indoor 3D object that was provided as a relative coordinate with only 3D
geometric features, several steps were needed: adding the object to the
system, storing the object as an absolute coordinate, and linking the
object with an outdoor mapping service. In addition, to provide more
useful information about indoor POIs generated from 3D models for users,
detailed information should be further managed by directly using the
Open APIs designed in this study. Subsequently, a mobile web mapping
service system to visualize indoor contents was deployed to deliver
practical processing and improvements based on the deployed Open API.
The possibility of effective management and application of POIs related
to indoor contents was confirmed through the mobile web-mapping demo
service that was established using Open API.},

    abstract = {It is becoming increasingly clear that the concepts of open government data (OGD) and co-creation are related; however, there is currently only limited empirical material available exploring the link between the two. This paper aims to help clarify the relationship between these two concepts by exploring a recently coined phenomenon: OGD-driven co-created public services. These services 1) utilize or are driven by OGD; 2) are co-created by stakeholders from different groups; and 3) produce public value for society. Due to the relative newness of the phenomenon an inductive exploratory case study is undertaken on Chicago's use of OGD in the co-creation of their food safety inspection forecasting model. This model forecasts critical food safety violations at food serving establishments and sends inspectors to the highest risk establishments first. The results of this exploratory work led to the discovery of a ‘perfect storm’ of six factors that seem to play a key role in allowing OGD-driven public service co-creation to take place. These factors are motivated stakeholders, innovative leaders, proper communication, an existing OGD portal, external funding, and agile development. © 2018 The Authors},

    abstract = {Providing access to non-confidential government data to the public is one of the initiatives adopted by many governments today to embrace government transparency practices. The initiative of publishing non-confidential government data for the public to use and re-use without restrictions is known as Open Government Data (OGD). Nevertheless, after several years after its inception, the direction of OGD implementation remains uncertain. The extant literature on OGD adoption concentrates primarily on identifying factors influencing adoption decisions. Yet, studies on the underlying factors influencing OGD after the adoption phase are scarce. Based on these issues, this study investigated the post-adoption of OGD in the public sector, particularly the data provider agencies. The OGD post-adoption framework is crafted by anchoring the Technology–Organization–Environment (TOE) framework and the innovation adoption process theory. The data was collected from 266 government agencies in the Malaysian public sector. This study employed the partial least square-structural equation modeling as the statistical technique for factor analysis. The results indicate that two factors from the organizational context (top management support, organizational culture) and two from the technological context (complexity, relative advantage) have a significant contribution to the post-adoption of OGD in the public sector. The contribution of this study is threefold: theoretical, conceptual, and practical. This study contributed theoretically by introducing the post-adoption framework of OGD that comprises the acceptance, routinization, and infusion stages. As the majority of OGD adoption studies conclude their analysis at the adoption (decisions) phase, this study gives novel insight to extend the analysis into unexplored territory, specifically the post-adoption phase. Conceptually, this study presents two new factors in the environmental context to be explored in the OGD adoption study, namely, the data demand and incentives. The fact that data providers are not influenced by data requests from the agency’s external environment and incentive offerings is something that needs further investigation. In practicality, the findings of this study are anticipated to assist policymakers in strategizing for long-term OGD implementation from the data provider’s perspective. This effort is crucial to ensure that the OGD initiatives will be incorporated into the public sector’s service thrust and become one of the digital government services provided to the citizen. © 2022 Mustapa et al.

    abstract = {Under the background of big data, citizens can freely access and use open data to create value through the open government data platform (OGDP). The sustainable use of OGDP can meet the needs of citizens. The value created by citizens can also improve quality of life, which is of great significance to the sustainable development of society. From the citizens’ perspective, we constructed an evaluation model of citizens’ sustainable use of OGDP, including 12 indicators in four dimensions: Data, platform, outcome, and citizen. We have built the complete evaluation system with the DANP (Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory-Based Analytic Network Process) method. It explores the main influencing factors and mutual influence of citizens’ sustainable use of OGDP. Empirical research is done on four provincial OGDPs in China’s Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guizhou, and Fujian provinces. The TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) method was used to rank the OGDPs in four pilot areas in empirical research. The results demonstrate that the improvement priorities of dimensions have the following order: Citizen, outcome, data, and platform, in which data and platform are cause dimensions, and outcome and citizen are result dimensions. The satisfaction indicator has the highest weight among all evaluation indicators, followed by the quality and quantity of outcomes. The one with the lowest weight is non-discrimination. The empirical results show that the OGDP in Zhejiang ranks the highest overall, followed by the OGDPs of Shanghai, Fujian, and Guizhou provinces. In the outcome and citizen dimensions, Zhejiang provincial OGDP does the best. Fujian provincial OGDP does the best in the platform dimension. The citizens’ sustainable use of OGDP can be promoted by timely opening of data that citizens need urgently, perfecting the policy of privacy protection and user guide of OGDP, holding open data innovation competition, providing data visualization function, providing various download formats of data sets, and simplifying the download procedures for citizens. © 2022 by the authors.

    abstract = {Purpose: Open government data (OGD) are considered as a technology capable of promoting transparency openness, and accountability, which in turn has a positive impact on innovation activities and creates responsive government, collaboration, cooperation, co-creation and participation. The purpose of this paper is to explore the adoption of OGD and open data portals among students, in an attempt to discover how governments can improve their actions in this respect. Design/methodology/approach: This study develops a behavioural intention-based analysis using constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, which is supplemented with additional constructs that meet the purpose of the study. In total, ten constructs divided into 33 items constituted the input for our study. Input data for the developed model have been collected through a structured questionnaire distributed between bachelor's and master's level students in three countries – the Czech Republic, India and Latvia. A structural equation modelling technique was used to analyse the relationships between variables of the model and test the nine hypothesis defined. Findings: Six constructs have been identified to facilitate significant relationships with behavioural intention. The analysis of the results of the three countries allows us to draw more objective conclusions in respect to the aim of the study and to reveal country-specific aspects that need to be addressed in the future. Originality/value: This study adds to the existing literature few theoretical and practical aspects. It highlights the role of open data portals as a central point of OGD infrastructures. It enables governments to understand the relationships among the related constructs, improving their actions and modifying their data infrastructures accordingly. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Public value creation is one of the most important opportunities of open government data (OGD) for different stakeholders including public sector agencies, private businesses, academia, citizens, and civic organizations. However, OGD has hardly any value on its own, yet the value is created by its use, hence supporting OGD portal use is a key point to delivering public value. Indeed, making an effective impact on OGD requires users to activate its value. Therefore, this study aims to propose a model to explore factors that hinder or facilitate public value creation using OGD from the public sector employee perspective. Using the DeLone and McLean (2003) model as a theoretical basis with the combination of the Moore (1995) framework, the study model was validated in the Australian public sector, using partial least square structural equation modelling. The results of this study support the validity of the research model and discover the factors that have a significant influence on public value creation through the use of OGD in the Australian public sector. Findings reveal that employee's OGD portal use and their satisfaction significantly predict the public value of OGD, while the OGD portal quality, open data quality and service support indirectly affect the public value of OGD. Furthermore, the moderator analysis suggests that awareness of the value of OGD among public sector employees has a critical effect on the delivery of public value. The proposed theoretical framework can be used to assess the factors affecting OGD public value creation by users in the public sector, which can help researchers and developers to improve and update their system, based on the results. © 2024 The Authors},

    abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to look at challenges that hinder small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from using open data (OD). The research gaps identified are then used to propose a next generation of OD platform (ODP+). Design/methodology/approach: This study proposes a more effective platform for SMEs called ODP+. A proof of concept was implemented by using modern techniques and technologies, with a pilot conducted among selected SMEs and government employees to test the approach’s viability. Findings: The findings identify current OD platforms generally, and in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, they encounter several difficulties, including that the data sets are complex to understand and determine their potential for reuse. The application of big data analytics in mitigating the identified challenges is demonstrated through the artefacts that have been developed. Research limitations/implications: This paper discusses several challenges that must be addressed to ensure that OD is accessible, helpful and of high quality in the future when planning and implementing OD initiatives. Practical implications: The proposed ODP+ integrates social network data, SME data sets and government databases. It will give SMEs a platform for combining data from government agencies, third parties and social networks to carry out complex analytical scenarios or build the needed application using artificial intelligence. Social implications: The findings promote the potential future utilisation of OD and suggest ways to give users access to knowledge and features. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no study provides extensive research about OD in Qatar or GCC. Further, the proposed ODP+ is a new platform that allows SMEs to run natural language data analytics queries. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Open government data (OGD) and information and communication technologies (ICT) are potential enablers in meeting information needs related to finding employment opportunities, but there is little evidence-based theorization to guide this enablement and avoid the barriers that hinder its use. The potential economic contribution of OGD has been researched in depth, but the potential of OGD for human development, specifically in developing countries, has not been theorized substantially. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate “how the role of ICT and OGD in meeting the employment-related information needs of unemployed South African youth can be understood better by the application of the Choice Framework”. The Choice Framework is Kleine's analytical tool for investigating ICTs for development toward a contextualized understanding of the relationships among the framework's elements, namely structure, agency, the dimension of choice and development outcomes. The research design was a single, exploratory case study; the data was collected in Alexandra Township of the Gauteng Province in South Africa using semi-structured interviews. Data was collected from 34 participants (between the ages of 18 and 35) who were looking for employment. The data was analyzed thematically and then unpacked in terms of the constructors of the Choice Framework. The findings show that most participants had access to ICT but limited awareness of OGD, and several challenges in using OGD for finding employment-related information were identified. The findings provide a theory-based contextual understanding of the research space, including the challenges and recommendations for overcoming said challenges of finding information on employment opportunities. © 2023 The Authors.

    abstract = {Open government data (OGD) include the provision of government data, which have so far been reserved for the provision of public utilities and services, wherein different stakeholders may create value out of the same source. Recently, OGD initiatives around the world have dampened or were found to be inadequate for one or other reasons. The present study seeks to underline the root causes behind these inadequate or stalled initiatives with a specific focus on the developing countries. This article undertakes a literature review of the most significant studies in this area, followed by a root cause analysis wherein the database across Scopus and Web of Science has been explored with the set inclusion and exclusion criteria being set in line with the research focusing on the hinderances and bottlenecks behind the failure of OGD initiatives (n ~ 15), thus not only summarizing what has been revealed in previous studies but also identifying these “root-cause” relationships, which are responsible for the stalled OGD projects. A deep understanding of the literature on OGD shows that research of OGD barriers repeat each other. The results show that the main root causes include politico-administrative, social, technological, legal and organizational (inter- and intra) dimensions including aspects like state of the economy, infrastructural issues, the tendency to copy the OGD initiative without need to institutionalize the same, and so forth. Whereas a number of studies are available covering the barriers in the roll-out and implementation of OGD initiatives, the root causes behind the existence of these barriers have not been identified so far-the present study seeks to plug this gap. Besides being a contribution to the extant OGD literature in general, the study seeks to leave academic and practical implications for furthering up deliberations and discussions on the OGD themes with specific impetus upon the cause analysis of the failure in OGD initiatives and the manner in which the same may be corrected or preempted. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

This is an exploratory study with the purpose of proposing a vocabulary class revision on Social Security in the domain of the Brazilian Electronic Government, in order to expand and correct representation of the area. The methodology used was as follows: (1) literature research and review; (2) selection of the thematic class that will be studied; (3) analysis of the aspects related to categorization, use of language (natural or artificial); coverage of terms belonging to the scope of the vocabulary class studied, and relationships between the terms; (4) suggestions for reviewing social security class. The study identifies the structural weakness and conceptual inconsistencies found in the vocabulary. We further discuss the need to use consistent vocabulary representation for the data published with the intent of making them readable by machine and shareable among software applications. We affirm that there must be investments in existing vocabularies rather than efforts to develop new representation instruments. We think it is important that other public bodies, other than Empresa de Tecnologia e Informações da Previdência Social, become interested in analyzing and proposing changes and updates on classes whose theme contemplates the data managed by them. We conclude that the use of the Controlled Vocabulary of Electronic Government can go beyond a map for surfing web pages of the Brazilian public sector, consisting of a dynamic tool of knowledge organization that can be used for various purposes, in accordance with the interests of each user.},

    abstract = {While Open Data initiatives are diverse, they aim to create and
contribute to public value. Yet several potential contradictions exist
between public values, such as trust, transparency, privacy, and
security, and Open Data policies. To bridge these contradictions, we
present the notion of precommitment as a restriction of one's choices.
Conceptualized as a policy instrument, precommitment can be applied by
an organization to restrict the extent to which an Open Data policy
might conflict with public values. To illustrate the use of
precommitment, we present two case studies at two public sector
organizations, where precommitment is applied during a data request
procedure to reconcile conflicting values. In this procedure,
precommitment is operationalized in three phases. In the first phase,
restrictions are defined on the type and the content of the data that
might be requested. The second phase involves the preparation of the
data to be delivered according to legal requirements and the decisions
taken in phase 1. Data preparation includes amongst others the deletion
of privacy sensitive or other problematic attributes. Finally, phase 3
pertains to the establishment of the conditions of reuse of the data,
limiting the use to restricted user groups or opening the data for
everyone.},

    abstract = {Under freedom of information (FOI) regulations, public officials are
pressured to grant citizens access to public information by responding
to citizen information requests. However, despite FOI regulations,
information requests are treated with varying bureaucratic attention,
resulting in a high number of ignored or overdue requests by public
organizations. Focusing on this bureaucratic discrimination, this study
aims to explain the determinants of varying bureaucratic responsiveness
to citizen information requests. Responsiveness in this case is
therefore either a successful response to the request, a refusal to
respond to the request, or no response at all (i.e., the request is
ignored). By drawing on public accountability, and thus a citizen-driven
model of bureaucratic responsiveness, we shed light on the human aspect
behind responsiveness to information requests. This research argues that
the request's topic as an accountability-seeking indicator and the
communication tone as an indicator for underlying emotions influence
responsiveness. The results from applying text mining and text analysis
techniques, such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis, on over
100,000 citizen information requests filed via a German online FOI
platform support these assumptions.},

    abstract = {Building on the promise of open data, government agencies support a continuously growing number of open data initiatives that are driven mainly by expectations of unprecedented value generation from an underutilized resource. Although data, in general, have undoubtedly become an essential resource for the economy, it has remained largely unclear how, or even whether, open data repositories generate any significant value. We addressed this void with a study that examines how sustainable value is generated from open data. Subsequently, we developed a model that explains how open data generate sustainable value through two underlying mechanisms. The first, the information sharing mechanism, explicates how open data are beneficial to forging informational content that creates value for society through increased transparency and improved decision-making. The second, the market mechanism, explicates how open data are beneficial as a resource in products and services offered on the market, as well as how open data are used to make processes more efficient or to satisfy previously unmet needs. We tested and validated the model using PLS with secondary quantitative data from 76 countries. The study provides empirical support to the conjecture that openness of data as well as the digital governance and digital infrastructure in a country have a positive effect on the country’s level of sustainable value. Overall, the study provides empirical evidence in favor of nurturing open data culture and insights about the conditions that support turning it into sustainable value for the benefit of citizens, business organizations, and society at large. © 2019 by the Association for Information Systems.},

The DGA envisages new forms of sharing public sector data (PSD). Based on a legal analysis of the DGA and an in-depth study of data governance literature, this paper highlights what is at stake in the new regulatory framework and argues that more than the mere openness of more PSD will be necessary to ensure that the European Union policy goals are achieved, especially those concerning enhancing innovation for the common good. From this perspective, the paper argues that the public data trust model of data governance and the Responsible Research and Innovation approach offer two powerful tools for public sector data governance. In this context, this paper contributes to the debate about new data governance models and discusses tools and frameworks enabling the use of data for the common good. It also provides insights to public administration practitioners aiming to implement a framework for increased and sustainable PSD sharing. © 2024 – The authors.},

    abstract = {Business models for open data have emerged in response to the economic opportunities presented by the increasing availability of open data. However, scholarly efforts providing elaborations, rigorous analysis and comparison of open data models are very limited. This could be partly attributed to the fact that most discussions on Open Data Business Models (ODBMs) are predominantly in the practice community. This shortcoming has resulted in a growing list of ODBMs which, on closer examination, are not clearly delineated and lack clear value orientation. This has made the understanding of value creation and exploitation mechanisms in existing open data businesses difficult and challenging to transfer. Following the Design Science Research (DSR) tradition, we developed a 6-Value (6-V) business model framework as a design artifact to facilitate the explication and detailed analysis of existing ODBMs in practice. Based on the results from the analysis, we identify business model patterns and emerging core value disciplines for open data businesses. Our results not only help streamline existing ODBMs and help in linking them to the overall business strategy, but could also guide governments in developing the required capabilities to support and sustain the business models. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

    abstract = {Open data are considered an essential resource for governments,
businesses, and citizens. In that context, open data portals have
potential for creating enormous economic growth. Open data portals
should allow the reuse of open data, ensure the efficiency of data
transmission, and enable professional initiatives based on data reuse.
However, there are portals that are inefficient because they do not
allow reuse of their data. The objective of this work is to define and
identify open data portals that do not offer the possibility for
professional reuse of their data. We refer to them as ``pretender open
data portals{''}. The following research questions are considered
herein: What minimum criteria must an open data portal satisfy to enable
professional reuse of open data? How can portals that do not meet these
criteria be identified? And, what problems might these portals present,
and how they might be solved? The results of an analysis of two samples
of open data portals in Spain reveal that 63.8\% and 56.1\% of the
portals analyzed in 2019 and 2021, respectively, can be considered
pretender open data portals. The existence of pretender open data
portals can have negative economic and social impacts, such as wasting
public resources and projecting a negative image of the government's
open data policies. To find coordination mechanisms to develop open data
portals that, through the professional reuse of their data can create
economic and social value, is one important challenge. The analysis of
best practices of open data portals can be also a way to go in deep in
the understanding of open data reuse impact not only from a professional
standpoint.},

    abstract = {An updated metric developed to assess the degree of open data
reusability, called MEtric for the evaLuation of Open DAta: Meloda 5 is
presented. Previous version of the metric, Meloda 4, had six dimensions:
the legal licensing of data, the mechanisms to access the data, the
technical standards of the datasets, the data model, the geographic
content of the data and the updating frequency. With all these
dimensions, the metric provides a quantitative evaluation about how
reusable the datasets released are. During the last five years, this
metric has been cited and used by some other authors but the extensive
use of the metric has brought to light some of its limitations. In order
to get deeper insights into the topic, a panel of international experts
has been surveyed about two aspects of the metric. First aspect was what
other factors should be considered in order to qualify the reusability
of a released dataset. And the second aspect was the internal structure,
the levels for every dimension of the metric; if they should be
increased, merged, removed or divided. Considering the results of the
survey, first, we identify the factors / dimensions that should be kept:
legal licensing, access to information, technical standard,
standardization, geolocation content and updating frequency of data.
Second, we consider the inclusion of two new dimensions: dissemination
and reputation. Then, we present the new internal structure, the levels
for each dimension, and the measures to evaluate the degree of reuse of
each dataset. Finally, a standardization of the metric for other steps
of the data impact process, data reuse analytics and data-driven
services generation are presented together with future research lines.},

    abstract = {The open data (OD) performance expectancy is a critical factor for the
user technology acceptance models for future implementation OD in
Industry 4.0, and to have an impact in area of Society 5.0. The purpose
of this article is identifying trends and key words (leading terms) in
promoting ODs for their use in Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0. We are also
looking for leaders in Europe in promoting the use of OD in the context
of Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0. The research methodology includes
methods such as: analyses based on text mining, visualization
techniques, and multidimensional cluster analyses with correlation
analyses. The dataset covered 288 digital products and services based on
OD. The timeframe covers the period January 2018-January 2020, and the
research focuses on European issues. The research is focused on texts
promoting the digital OD products and services, with the most popular
being applications, websites and platforms. The main direction in
presenting the benefits of their use is related to promoting them as
tools to provide real time information on public issues, primarily in
areas such as transport, education, culture and sport, economics and
finance and health. The main types of OD are geodata and those specified
as national and local. Additionally, the geographical area in
Europe-dominating countries, and the key terms promoting product and
services in context of OD performance expectancy in Western Europe,
Northern Europe, Southern Europe and Eastern Europe, were found.},

    abstract = {Policy-makers expect that open data will be accepted and used more and more, resulting in a range of benefits including transparency, participation and innovation. The ability to use open data partly depends on the availability of open data technologies. However, the actual use of open data technologies has shown mixed results, and there is a paucity of research on the predictors affecting the acceptance and use of open data technologies. A better understanding of these predictors can help policy-makers to determine which policy instruments they can use to increase the acceptance and use of open data technologies. A modified model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) is used to empirically determine predictors influencing the acceptance and use of open data technologies. The results show that the predictors performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions and voluntariness of use together account for 45% of the variability in people's behavioral intention to use open data technologies. Except for facilitating conditions, all these predictors significantly influence behavioral intention. Our analysis of the predictors that influence the acceptance and use of open data technologies can be used to stimulate the use of open data technologies. The findings suggest that policy-makers should increase the acceptance and use of open data technologies by showing the benefits of open data use, by creating awareness of users that they already use open data, by developing social strategies to encourage people to stimulate each other to use open data, by integrating open data use in daily activities, and by decreasing the effort necessary to use open data technologies. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

    abstract = {Open data is increasingly being promoted as a route to achieve food
security and agricultural development. This article critically examines
the promotion of open agri-food data for development through a
document-based case study of the Global Open Data for Agriculture and
Nutrition (GODAN) initiative as well as through interviews with open
data practitioners and participant observation at open data events.
While the concept of openness is striking for its ideological
flexibility, we argue that GODAN propagates an anti-political,
neoliberal vision for how open data can enhance agricultural
development. This approach centers values such as private innovation,
increased production, efficiency, and individual empowerment, in
contrast to more political and collectivist approaches to openness
practiced by some agri-food social movements. We further argue that open
agri-food data projects, in general, have a tendency to reproduce
elements of ``data colonialism,{''} extracting data with minimal
consideration for the collective harms that may result, and embedding
their own values within universalizing information infrastructures.},

    abstract = {The opening up of public sector data has provided a new data resource
for the citizens. However, the use of open data and its consequent
societal value has proved not to be as extensive as initially hoped for,
although multiple innovations have emerged; rather it is still
considered problematic, and knowledge about open data use is scarce.
Therefore, the aim of this paper is to clarify open data use and
engagement by people outside the public sector, especially what motives
exists and how different user types align to these motives. To achieve
this, a document analysis has been carried out of reported use cases
identified in EU topic reports between 2014 and 2016. By applying the
theory of Relevant Social Groups (RSG), which focuses on the peoples
interpretation of the purpose with the technology, we identified five
RSGs representing overall motives for open data use: 1) Exploring for
creativity, 2) Creating business value, 3) Enabling local citizen value,
4) Addressing global societal challenges, and 5) Advocating the open
data agenda. We also discuss differences between the relevant social
groups and the included user types, issues and implications for
understanding the evolvement of the open data field, and suggests
research ahead.},

    abstract = {Recent advances in technology have made truly open and accessible government significantly more realisable. One of the ways in which governments are using this technology is in the implementation of online portals that allow open (i.e., public and unrestricted) access to data and use of data. Such portals can be used by citizens and professionals to facilitate improved decision-making across a wide range of areas, from car-parking to promoting entrepreneurialism. However, the existence of portals per se is not enough. To maximise their potential, users must also feel that they are both accessible and usable. To gain insights into the current state of usability of OGD portals for professionals working in data-related areas, a comparative study of the portals of the G7 group was carried out, using a mixed methodology. This is the first specific comparison of these portals for such users, as well as the first study to add a user-centred qualitative dimension to the research. The study’s findings showed that the G7 countries are not maximising the potential of their portals or collaborating effectively. Addressing these issues, and building better cross-national consistency, would help to improve the value delivered by investment in OGD portals. The study also further supported an existing user-centred, heuristic evaluation framework for application to a more specific user group, as well as more generally. © 2021 by the authors.

its potential to fuel digital innovation. Despite this, there is a
paucity of study into the role of OD for SMEs, in contrast to the
growing literature that has focused on the collection and sharing of OD

research by analysing the main capabilities needed to overcome existing
barriers to successfully manage OD in SMEs. Building upon the recent
SME-oriented OI literature and adopting an interpretative absorptive
capacity framework, we analyse the data collected from 30
semi-structured interviews with experts working in UK organisations
adopting OD-based OI strategies. We find a number of core factors that
shape OD acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation by
SMEs. Results show that without the specific OD capabilities identified
in our study, it will be difficult for SMEs to successfully use OD,
which may explain why the uptake of OD by SMEs more broadly has so far
been limited. These unique OD capabilities need to be better developed
by OD using SMEs, if this `raw material' for the digital economy is to
be fully exploited.},

    abstract = {Despite the large number of technology-intensive organisations, their
corporate know-how and underlying workforce skill are not mature enough
for a successful rollout of Artificial Intelligence (AI) services in the
near-term. However, things have started to change, owing to the
increased adoption of data democratisation processes, and the capability
offered by emerging technologies for data sharing while respecting
privacy, protection, and security, as well as appropriate learning-based
modelling capabilities for non-expert end-users. This is particularly
evident in the energy sector. In this context, the aim of this paper is
to analyse AI and data democratisation, in order to explore the
strengths and challenges in terms of data access problems and data
sharing, algorithmic bias, AI transparency, privacy and other regulatory
constraints for AI-based decisions, as well as novel applications in
different domains, giving particular emphasis on the energy sector. A
data democratisation framework for intelligent energy management is
presented. In doing so, it highlights the need for the democratisation
of data and analytics in the energy sector, toward making data available
for the right people at the right time, allowing them to make the right
decisions, and eventually facilitating the adoption of decentralised,
decarbonised, and democratised energy business models.},

    abstract = {As the world's population is becoming progressively urban-dwelling,
sustainable development challenges are increasingly concentrated in
cities, placing tremendous pressure on society to build more
sustainable, innovative, and equitable urban environments. Consequently,
today's cities require integrated policies and new innovative ways to
manage and improve the complexity of urban living conditions. The
growing volume and variety of data produced in the urban ecosystem are
crucial for obtaining the city's insights and building knowledge-based
solutions for a smarter and more sustainable urban development. In this
paper, we look at the open data impacts on these complex ecosystems and
its crucial enabler role for the generation and analysis of contextual
and actionable data aimed at understanding, managing, and planning the
city. Despite the importance of open data, the literature is scarce in
systematic and structured research that evaluates its impacts on the
smart city context. This paper explores this gap by proposing a
theoretical framework, composed of a model and an experiment grounded on
the use of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT), designed to give a more
detailed view concerning the context and characteristics of the impacts
of open data initiatives on smart cities' sustainable development. This
work will contribute to open data management and smart city development,
providing boundaries and theoretical insights for further research and
experimentation on how open data can be leveraged to develop better
smart cities.},

    abstract = {In the COVID-19 pandemic, access to data on the disease has become
strategic for controlling public health measures. Faced with the health
emergency, a large volume of data needed to be minimally organized and
made available in a quick and automated way, composing the open
government data. After two years of a pandemic and in order to present
an overview of the publication of open data by the federal government of
Brazil, on COVID-19, this study sought to evaluate the open government
data made available through the Application Programming Interface (API).
The methodology involved the identification of datasets on COVID-19 in
Brazil, in Application Programming Interface, until April 2022, the
analysis of the documentation and the evaluation using the DGABr metric.
The evaluation considered the five perspectives of the metric that
measures fundamental elements about the open government data, essential
for interoperability and consequently reuse of the data and was based on
the published documentation. As results, the open government data on
COVID-19, made available in Application Programming Interface, presented
a good score in the metric, reaching level 4. This result indicates that
the use of APIs was an important and agile technological resource for
the organization and availability of open government data, promoting its
reuse. However, it is important to highlight that this availability to
society was late, it needs constant improvements, mainly in technical
issues such as the connection of data with other sources, and that the
effective reuse actions were limited to data visualization panels on
COVID-19.},

    abstract = {This paper aims to provide a broad perspective on the development of
benchmarking open data efforts through indices and rankings over the
years, both at the level of countries and allowing for a cross-country
comparison. The methodology follows a systematic search for the relevant
resources, their classification and identification of six open data
benchmarks to be further analyzed, the identification of their key
components through decomposition, their description, and identifying the
similarities and differences. Three major groups of indices and four
periods that characterize the efforts to benchmark and measure the
development of open data are identified, where the first measure the
openness of the selected categories of data, the second focuses on
different aspects of the open data ecosystem, using a large number of
variables, and the third is a combination of both approaches.
Recommendations as well as trends that can form the benchmarking
frameworks in the future are also discussed. The findings are of a high
importance for individual countries, which allow for correct and
accurate interpretation of the results changes in the scope of a given
index or rank, i.e., whether the difference in results is the result of
national efforts or the subject of changes in the specific index, as
well as how to combine and interpret the results of a number of indices
for correct decision-making and for the definition of the future actions
where the results vary significantly. In addition, the findings are also
important for international organizations publishing benchmarking
reports.},

The research performance of eight benchmark technological universities in Taiwan is compared in this study. In addition, the trends in research topics in the top 10% of journals are explored. Descriptive statistics, correlation, ANOVA, and the Boston Consulting Group matrix were used in this study. Research personnel, publications, productivity, total citations, number of international collaborations, and academic research income in 2018 significantly positively correlated with each other. From 719 records of research topics, topic clusters and school types are the significant factors in research outputs. Biosensors, electrodes, and voltammetry are the leading topic clusters in the research trend. The topic cluster of decision-making, fuzzy sets, and models has the best growth rate in the SciVal results. This analysis provides useful insights to policymakers to improve institutional administration and research resource allocation. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

    abstract = {This work shows the current situation of Open Government at a Latin American level focused on the quality of available open data related to COVID-19. The analyzed data refers to health emergencies and tasks for the fight against the pandemic. These data are critical because they are used to improve the management of public services and resources in handling this contingency. The different quality aspects of open data that are available on government portals have been analyzed. For this analysis, a number of documents of recognized international organizations on aspects, current problems, and good practices were taken as a reference. To accomplish this research, six countries were chosen as a data source: Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Paraguay and Uruguay. For each of them, their public portals were analyzed, and special attention was paid to the quality aspects that each country proposes, as well as whether there are dataset control tools or not. Finally, the tool HEVDA was used to verify the quality of open data based on a proposal of 8 quality metrics. The tool was applied to a sample of 15 datasets from each country in aspects of COVID-19 (90 datasets). The contribution of this work is to identify the degree of quality presented by the open data of these countries through a self-developed validation tool (HEVDA). © 2023, Revista Facultad de Ingenieria.

    abstract = {Governments have invested in open data processes as one of the ways to
improve management and promote greater transparency in society. In this
sense, reconciling the data offered with the effective interest of
society in them is essential. The objective of this work was to verify
whether the data that society requests are consistent with the
information made available by federal universities, in an open format.
By accessing secondary data (open data plans and federal university
pages), between 2016 and 2021, we can highlight the following results:
the data offer is consistent with the assumptions made in the open data
plans; there is a large mismatch between demand and supply of data, thus
requiring greater attention from HEIs to society's demands; this
mismatch is even greater in data referring to management, in relation to
data referring to the academic context (teaching, research and
extension); and finally, which operational factors are one of the main
barriers to making data available in an open format.},

    abstract = {Sustainable open data management systems are key elements to overcome long-term publishing and consumption challenges on open data platforms. However, most existing solutions have not been envisaged as sustainable approaches to cope with key data attributes such as timeliness, accessibility and usability. In this paper, we present a framework that addresses these challenges and ensures the efficient publication of dynamic data on open data platforms, as well as improving the consumption experience of end-users. The framework describes the architecture of a sustainable system that can operate continuously in an automated way. It involves: 1) introducing an evolvable and scalable ecosystem to guarantee the access to dynamic data when they are made available; 2) tackling governance using an autonomous agent to provide the capacity of dynamically publishing/unpublishing data resources on open data platforms. It ensures easier accessibility and greater efficiency for data developers, facilitating the development of data-enabled products, thus helping developers to seize the opportunities of the data economy; and 3) improving the consumption experience by introducing conversational bots, which enhances the usability of open data. We demonstrate the results and validity of the solution in practice through its implementation, evaluation and exploitation as a practical system in the Parliament of the Canary Islands, Spain. The framework developed can be considered a generic solution to manage open data publishing and consumption challenges in other domains. © 2013 IEEE.},

    abstract = {Governments around the world make their data available through platforms
but, disappointingly, the use of this data is lagging behind. This
problem has been recognized in the literature and to facilitate use of
open datasets, scholars have focused on identifying general user
requirements for open data platform design. This approach however fails
to take into account the variation of open data practices and specific
contexts of usage. This study, therefore, argues that next to general
requirements: we also need to collect context-specific user requirements
for open data platforms. We take different societal issues as the
starting point for open data platform design. To illustrate the value of
this context-specific approach, we apply scenario-based design
methodology in the Province of Groningen in The Netherlands. The results
show that different scenarios result partly in similar but also partly
in different user requirements, leading to a deeper and richer
understanding of user requirements. We conclude that a context-specific
approach thereby connecting data, users and societal issues can be used
to guide government agencies and designers in efforts to develop open
data platforms that actually meet the needs of citizens.},

    abstract = {Government officials claim open data can improve internal and external communication and collaboration. These promises hinge on “data intermediaries”: extra-institutional actors that obtain, use, and translate data for the public. However, we know little about why these individuals might regard open data as a site of civic participation. In response, we draw on Ilana Gershon to conceptualize culturally situated and socially constructed perspectives on data, or “data ideologies.” This study employs mixed methodologies to examine why members of the public hold particular data ideologies and how they vary. In late 2015 the authors engaged the public through a commission in a diverse city of approximately 500,000. Qualitative data was collected from three public focus groups with residents. Simultaneously, we obtained quantitative data from surveys. Participants’ data ideologies varied based on how they perceived data to be useful for collaboration, tasks, and translations. Bucking the “geek” stereotype, only a minority of those surveyed (20%) were professional software developers or engineers. Although only a nascent movement, we argue open data intermediaries have important roles to play in a new political landscape. © The Author(s) 2017.},

We draw upon a longitudinal dataset comprising 90 countries observed over the period 2013–2016. We find a significant and positive association between OD publishing and entrepreneurship at the country level. The results also show that OD publishing and entrepreneurship is strong in countries with high institutional quality. We argue that publishing OD is not sufficient to improve innovative entrepreneurship alone, so states need to move beyond a focus on OD initiatives and promotion, to focus on a broader set of policy initiatives that promote good governance. © 2022 European Union.

    abstract = {Governments worldwide have invested resources in publishing open data to promote new business and services and to promote transparency and accountability of public policies. However, due to different factors, such as different file formats and different information granularity, these data end up in informational silos, without having additional value besides what is contained in the data file itself. The linked data technology supports addressing this sort of problem, providing principles-based on Web standards-to connect distributed and heterogeneous data sources. Nevertheless, studies in the literature have shown that the perception of quality around open linked datasets is low, what impacts the consumption and reuse of these information by the society. In this work, we propose a model of process which embeds quality control activities (verification and validation) during the process. We adopted the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology to conceive and assess the method, using an illustrative case study. A quality assessment framework was applied and the case studys results were compared to others in the literature, showing an improvement in overall quality, through the selected metrics.  © 2003-2012 IEEE.},

    abstract = {Open government data, as open data, are published to let interested stakeholders exploit data and create value out of them, but limited technical skills are a crucial barrier. Moreover, data silos within any public agency behave as a further obstacle in enabling collaboration between different working groups. This paper investigates the acceptance level of a collaborative platform to co-create, analyze, and visualize open government data within an Italian Regional Public Administration—the Campania region. This investigation first requires retracing and documenting the organizational changes applied to the Campania Region in moving from a siloed structure to a more horizontal and collaborative one. Second, it introduces the technical and technological contribution provided by the proposal of a Social Platform on Open Data (SPOD) as a regional public administration back-office, i.e., an internal platform, co-designed with public agency delegates and referred to as Campania Crea. Finally, it reports on the training session moderated by the University of Salerno to evaluate the acceptance rate of the proposed platform in real settings by involving 54 public agency members in actively using Campania Crea to co-create, analyze, and visualize open government data. The After Scenario Questionnaire was used to assess the acceptance level and attitude in using Campania Crea to report task-based results and the Technology Acceptance Model as an overall assessment of the platform acceptance level. As a result, Campania Crea supports regional public administration members in accomplishing their daily tasks concerning co-creation, analysis, and visualization of open data who positively accepted Campania Crea as a back-office tool. However, further effort should be invested in raising awareness and developing skills concerning open government data management. © 2023 by the authors.},

    abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is stimulating improvements in remote access and
use of technology in conservation-related programs and research. In many
cases, organizations have intended for remote engagement to benefit
groups that have been marginalized in the sciences. But are they? It is
important to consider how remote access affects social justice in
conservation biology-i.e., the principle that all people should be
equally respected and valued in conservation organizations, programs,
projects, and practices. To support such consideration, we describe a
typology of justice-oriented principles that can be used to examine
social justice in a range of conservation activities. We apply this
typology to three conservation areas: (1) remote access to US national
park educational programs and data; (2) digitization of natural history
specimens and their use in conservation research; and (3) remote
engagement in conservation-oriented citizen science. We then address the
questions: Which justice-oriented principles are salient in which
conservation contexts or activities? How can those principles be best
realized in those contexts or activities? In each of the three areas we
examined, remote access increased participation, but access and benefits
were not equally distributed and unanticipated consequences have not
been adequately addressed. We identify steps that can and are being
taken to advance social justice in conservation, such as assessing
programs to determine if they are achieving their stated social
justice-oriented aims and revising initiatives as needed. The framework
that we present could be used to assess the social justice dimensions of
many conservation programs, institutions, practices, and policies.},

    abstract = {The disclosure of open government data follows a growing trend in recent
years, reaching all spheres of government. The objective of the study is
to investigate the management of open government data and the
achievement in practice of the expected objectives in view of its
availability and publication. It has a qualitative approach, using
documentary research to prospect for data and information. To this end,
it was decided, based on an international reference model for the
adoption of open data management, the Open Data Charter, to make
comparisons of the open data plans published by four public
institutions, two of which are nationwide and two international
governments, aiming at understanding the level of adherence of these
plans to the principles and objectives of the DAGs proposed in the
reference model. The open data plans that were in force at these
institutions at the date of data collection in 2018 were analyzed. The
results allow us to state that actions related to community
participation and interactions with society need to be promoted in the
management processes. The study contributes with a reference model of
open government data that meets the demands of citizens for information,
transparency, better public services and spaces for participation in
public management.},

    abstract = {Over the last decade growing amounts of government data have been made available in an attempt to increase transparency and civic participation, but it is unclear if this data serves non-expert communities due to gaps in access and the technical knowledge needed to interpret this 'open' data. We conducted a two-year design study focused on the creation of a community-based data display using the United States Environmental Protection Agency data on water permit violations by oil storage facilities on the Chelsea Creek in Massachusetts to explore whether situated data physicalization and Participatory Action Research could support meaningful engagement with open data. We selected this data as it is of interest to local groups and available online, yet remains largely invisible and inaccessible to the Chelsea community. The resulting installation, Chemicals in the Creek, responds to the call for community-engaged visualization processes and provides an application of situated methods of data representation. It proposes event-centered and power-aware modes of engagement using contextual and embodied data representations. The design of Chemicals in the Creek is grounded in interactive workshops and we analyze it through event observation, interviews, and community outcomes. We reflect on the role of community engaged research in the Information Visualization community relative to recent conversations on new approaches to design studies and evaluation. © 2020 IEEE.},

Here we describe the results of a study providing evidence about the risks of such an approach via a simulated attack on two social survey datasets. This is also the first systematic attempt to simulate a jigsaw identification attack (one using a mashup of multiple data sources) on an anonymised dataset. The information that we draw on is collected from multiple online data sources and purchasable commercial data. The results indicate that such an attack against anonymised end user licence (EUL) datasets, if converted into open datasets, is possible and therefore we would recommend that penetration tests should be factored into any decision to make datasets (that are about people) open. © Statistics Sweden.},

    abstract = {Open data and open innovation are two topics currently attracting the
attention of academics. But no previous studies consider these fields in
combination while using a bibliometric approach. Thus, the aim of this
paper is to understand the relationship between open innovation and open
data. Two research questions have been formulated: 1) What are the main
topics studied in the literature that combine both lines of research?
and 2) How can the open innovation paradigm be integrated in the open
data impact process? To address the first question, a co-word analysis
is used to identify the main topics investigated in the open innovation
and open data literature. Based on our results, to answer the second
research question, the topics are grouped and analyzed considering a
model of the open data impact process. Finally, some future research
lines to analyze the open data impact process for open innovation are
presented. For example, future research could focus on questions such as
(1) What kind of applications can be created through the reuse of open
data?; and (2) How do open innovation processes influence the reuse of
open data?},

    abstract = {[Purpose/Significance]Government open data has been in China for 10 years, however, the actual use of it has been criticised. This study analyses citizens' willingness to use government open data from their perspectives and constructs a model, aiming to promote in-depth research on citizens' use of government open data. [Methodology/Process] Meta-ethnographic qualitative research method was adopted to synthesise and integrate the 25 original studies. [Results/Conclusions] The study finally constructed a model of factors influencing citizens' willingness to use government open data, and identified four dimensions: "citizen", "platform", “government” and "environment". The four dimensions of "citizen", "platform", “government” and “environment” were identified, of which “citizen” involves "intrinsic motivation", "behavioural attitude", “information attitude” and "information security". The four dimensions of “Citizen” include "Intrinsic Motivation", "Behavioural Attitude", "Information Literacy", and "Demographic Characteristics", while the four dimensions of “Platform” include "Data Quality", "Information Literacy", and "Demographic Characteristics". platform" involves the sub-dimensions of “data quality” and "platform quality", “government” involves the sub-dimensions of “organisational conditions” and "policies and regulations", and “government” involves the sub-dimensions of “organisational conditions” and "policies and regulations". government" involves two sub-dimensions, “organisational conditions” and "policies and regulations", and “environment” involves two sub-dimensions, “social environment” and "type of context", with each sub-dimension having a different impact on the use of open government data by citizens. The different factors under each sub-dimension have different degrees of influence on citizens' use of open government data. Finally, suggestions are made to enhance citizens' willingness to use open government data. © 2023 The Authors},

    abstract = {Since the beginning of the release of open data by many countries, different methodologies for publishing linked data have been proposed. However, they seem not to be adopted by early studies exploring linked data for different reasons. In this work, we conducted a systematic mapping in the literature to synthesize the different approaches around the following topics: common steps, associated tools and practices, quality assessment validations, and evaluation of the methodology. The findings show a core set of activities, based on the linked data principles, but with additional critical steps for practical use in scale. Furthermore, although a fair amount of quality issues are reported in the literature, very few of these methodologies embed validation steps in their process. We describe an integrated overview of the different activities and how they can be executed with appropriate tools. We also present research challenges that need to be addressed in future works in this area.  © 2023-The authors. Published by IOS Press.},

    abstract = {In last few years, many open government data portals have been emerging in the world. These portals publish open government datasets which can be accessed and used by everyone for their own needs. In this paper, we propose methodology named QODA (Quality of Open government DAtasets) for assessment of quality of published datasets via two aspects. First one is assessment of quality of pure open government datasets, and second is assessment of quality features on the platforms which contributes to the publication of quality datasets. It provides a step-by-step dataset analysis guidance and summarization of results. Research presented in this paper shows that open government dataset quality depends on data provider as well as proper definition of metadata behind datasets. Our findings result in recommendations to open government data (OGD) publishers, to constantly supervise the use of published datasets, with aim to have timely and punctual information on OGD portals, with special attention on quality features. © 2023 Scientific Publishers.

    abstract = {Cities in the United States are increasingly embracing open data as a
means of advancing a variety of interests. Promoting transparency,
facilitating public engagement, proactively managing records requests,
and fostering innovation in the public and private sectors are among the
commonly cited motivations for this phenomenon. While there is an
extensive literature on the benefits and challenges of open government
data, there are far fewer empirical studies that explore and document
how these initiatives are unfolding at the local government scale. This
article asks what kinds of data are being made open in U.S. cities and
to what extent do open data policies and related regulatory actions
matter in shaping the content and structure of public-facing
repositories. The authors conclude that population size and regulatory
actions exert a positive influence on the amount and variety of datasets
provided through municipal open data portals. Implications for the
design and governance of open government data initiatives at the local
level are also discussed.},

In a context of a global trust crisis in the European Union, this paper examines if open government data, a promising governance strategy, may help to boost Millennials’ and Generation Z trust in public institutions and satisfaction with public outcomes. First, results from our preliminary analysis challenge some popular beliefs by revealing that younger generations tend to trust in their institutions notably more than the rest of the European citizens. In addition, our findings show that open government data is a trust-enabler for Millennials and Generation Z, not only through a direct link between both, but also thanks to the mediator role of citizens’ satisfaction. Accordingly, public officers are encouraged to spread the implementation of open data strategies as a way to improve younger generations’ attachment to democratic institutions.

    abstract = {Background: The trend in producing linked open data to publish high-quality interlinked data has gained widespread traction in recent years. Various sectors are producing linked open data to increase public access and ensure transparency, in addition to a better utilization of government data, namely linked open government data. Problem Definition: As compared to the developed countries, Saudi Arabia lags behind in benefiting from this new era of ubiquitous web of data, despite its publication of government related data in non-linked format. In the context of Saudi open government data, the full potential of multi-category data published by various government agencies at different portals is not being realized as the data are not published in open data format and remain unlinked to other existing datasets. Methodology: To bridge this gap, this study presents a framework to extract and generate semantically enriched data from various data sources under different domains. The framework was used to produce the Saudi linked open government data cloud by interlinking data entities with each other and with external existing open datasets. Results: The effectiveness of our approach is validated by applying it to a socially significant issue, i.e., divorce rate, in Saudi Arabia. By posing smart queries to semantically enriched data, we were able to perform an in-depth analysis of different factors related to increasing divorce rates in Saudi Arabia. Arguably, without using linked open data and related technologies such analysis would not have been possible. Finally, we also present a simulated visual environment for better understanding and communication of such analysis for decision and policy makers.  © 2013 IEEE.},

    abstract = {In this paper, we document the counter-data action and data activism of a grassroots affordable housing advocacy group in Atlanta. Our observation and insight into these data activities and strategies are achieved through ethnographic and engaged research and participatory design. We find that counter-data action through community-collected data is rooted in a legacy of Atlanta’s black activism and black scholarship; that this data activism enabled resource mobilization and critical conscious making; and that design and media production are essential post counter-data action activities in data activism. Based on these findings, we urge the field of open government data to broaden their concept of social impact of data to include the use data to mobilize resources within oppressed communities not to influence policy and government but to build capacities within community in order to transform, not join, political structures. We also advocate that scholars within the fields of open government data, critical data studies, and data activism recognize the legacy and historic practice of data activism by black communities working towards social change. © The Author(s) 2018.},

    abstract = {This paper explores some of the key barriers to Open Government Data (OGD) that responsible civil servants in the UK face as they try to comply with the UK-led OGD initiative. Empirically, we provide a quantitative analysis of the resources published on the government's central OGD portal, data.gov.uk, and a unique insight into the publishing of OGD in the UK based on 22 interviews with responsible individuals at the operational level of publishing OGD. Our findings reveal that while the barriers to open government information have been substantially reduced, the barriers to open government data persist. Even the most enthusiastic responsible individuals face considerable obstacles in publishing OGD. Further, a key barrier to OGD in the UK is its impression management strategy based on its informational rather than data orientation. Due to the UK's pioneering position in the OGD initiative, these findings are relevant to understanding and improving OGD programmes at local, national and international levels. The findings may subsequently lead to evidence-based strategies and policies. © 2019-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {Besides OpenStreetMap (OSM), there are other local sources, such as open government data (OGD), that have the potential to enrich the modeling process with decision criteria that uniquely reflect some local patterns. However, both data are affected by uncertainty issues, which limits their usability. This work addresses the imprecisions on suitability layers generated from such data. The proposed method is founded on fuzzy logic theories. The model integrates OGD, OSM data and remote sensing products and generate reliable landfill suitability results. A comparison analysis demonstrates that the proposed method generates more accurate, representative and reliable suitability results than traditional methods. Furthermore, the method has facilitated the introduction of open government data for suitability studies, whose fusion improved estimations of population distribution and land-use mapping than solely relying on free remotely sensed images. The proposed method is applicable for preparing decision maps from open datasets that have undergone similar generalization procedures as the source of their uncertainty. The study provides evidence for the applicability of OGD and other related open data initiatives (ODIs) for land-use suitability studies, especially in developing countries. © 2020 by the authors.

In order to address this gap, the paper at hand aims towards analyzing the landscape of Open Governmental Data in the European Union from a functional, semantic and technical perspective. Our research focused on the collection and categorization of an indicative number of public data sources for each of the 27 European Union country-members through investigating their services and characteristics. By modeling and classifying the data sources according to their key attributes, we were able to proceed to their statistical analysis and assessment in terms of their content, licensing, multilingual support, acquisition, ease of access, provision and data format. Our results portray the current quality of Public Sector Information infrastructures and highlight what still needs to be done in order to make public data truly open and readily available for researchers, citizens, companies and innovation in general. © 2014 Universidad de Talca - Chile.},

    abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to assess if the extent of openness and the coverage of data sets released by European governments have a significant impact on citizen trust in public institutions. Design/methodology/approach: Data for openness and coverage have been collected from the Open Data Inventory 2018 (ODIN), by Open Data Watch; institutional trust is built up as a formative construct based on the European Social Survey (ESS), Round 9. The relations between the open government data features and trust have been tested on the basis of structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings: The paper reveals that as European governments improve data openness, disaggregation, and time coverage, people tend to trust them more. However, the size of the effect is still small and, comparatively, data coverage effect on citizens’ confidence is more than twice than the impact of openness. Research limitations: This paper analyzes the causal effect of Open Government Data (OGD) features captured in a certain moment of time. In upcoming years, as OGD is implemented and a more consistent effect on people is expected, time series analysis will provide with a deeper insight. Practical implications: Public officers should continue working in the development of a technological framework that contributes to make OGD truly open. They should improve the added value of the increasing amount of open data currently available in order to boost internal and external innovations valuable both for public agencies and citizens. Originality/value: In a field of knowledge with little quantitative empirical evidence, this paper provides updated support for the positive effect of OGD strategies and it also points out areas of improvement in terms of the value that citizens can get from OGD coverage and openness. © 2021 Sciendo.

    abstract = {Extracting knowledge from open data of traffic accidents has been attracting increasing attention to policymakers responsible for road safety. This article presents a knowledge elicitation approach to exploring the determinants of traffic accidents from open government data of an urban area in Taiwan. The collected open dataset contains 34 decisional attributes and one predictive attribute (i.e., type of injury, including head, breast, leg), and 47,974 cases. Prediction models using a classification-oriented mechanism and generated rules that considered datasets from before (B-dataset; 30,116 cases) and after (A-dataset; 17,868 cases) beginning to combat the Covid-19 pandemic in an urban area of Taiwan were compared. The findings showed that prediction accuracy was acceptable but not high, at 70.73% for B-dataset and 74.77% for A-dataset. Determinants in the human and vehicle categories revealed higher classification ranks than those in the temporal and environment categories. Traffic accidents involving motorcycles were 5.13% higher in A-dataset, whereas those involving cars were 4.11% lower. Injury on leg or foot was 3.46% higher in A-dataset, whereas other types of injury were up to 1.00% lower. The average support for rules in the A-dataset rule base and the simplicity of the A-dataset decision tree were higher than those of B-dataset. The research demonstrates the value of open government data in prediction model development and knowledge elicitation to support policymaking in the traffic safety domain. © 2022 The Author(s)},

    abstract = {For many government departments, uncertainty aversion is a source of
barriers in the advancement of data openness. A more active response to
potential risks is needed and necessitates an in-depth examination of
risks related to open government data (OGD). With a cross-case study in
which three cases from the United Kingdom, the United States and China
are examined, this study identifies potential risks that might emerge at
different stages of the life cycle of OGD programs and constructs a
taxonomy model for them. The taxonomy model distinguishes the ``risks
from OGD{''} from the ``risks to OGD{''}, which can help government
departments make better responses. Finally, risk response strategies are
suggested based on the research results.},

National Continuously Operating Reference Station (NCORS), an
infrastructure supporting standard and precise positioning in spatial
activities. The application of OD policies on NCORS data (OD-NCORS)
varies per country. This article explores the approaches and impact of
OD-NCORS in three European countries: Germany, the Netherlands and
Sweden. Understanding the differences in the implementations may benefit
other countries in their strategies to implement OD for their NCORS. It
may also provide insights for organisations considering OD for other
data. The research found that the key factors affecting OD-NCORS
implementation are the national governing nature and the existence of
commercial CORS networks. There is no single approach for OD-NCORS
implementation that fits every national context.},

In this contribution I will explore the opportunities and challenges in the area, with a particular focus on tax compliance. I will focus on the data required to make further progress, discussing what can be improved when working with surveys and how the field could benefit from open government data initiatives. I focus on collaborative efforts among scientists as well as with the government or the tax administration and examine many potential areas of exploration. The opportunities currently emerging due to digitalization provide not only interesting avenues for collaborations but also a natural method of using tools such as lab and field experiments. In addition, I will discuss potential dangers faced by the field of behavioral economics that also threaten the field of behavioral taxation. © 2022 Mohr Siebeck.},

    abstract = {The Open Government Data (OGD) projects have spread rapidly in recent years, given that they involve a great transformative potential, whose aims to guarantee transparent government and stimulate the participation and citizenry engagement. It seems that there is a lack of studies analysing factors regarding both the access to OG projects and the volume and format of data published into OGD projects. Therefore, this paper seeks to identify main factors affecting both the way of accessing the OG projects and the volume and format of data published into OGD projects in larger Spanish municipalities (with >50,000 inhabitants and a sample of 145 municipalities). Our main findings seem to point out the intention of sample governments to increase their information disclosure as a way for enhancing their reputation or government's image introducing OGDPs initiatives. Also, it revels differences among analysed municipalities regarding the context in which the information is disclosed. © 2022 The Authors},

    abstract = {Data wrangling is the process whereby data are cleaned and integrated for analysis. Data wrangling, even with tool support, is typically a labour intensive process. One aspect of data wrangling involves carrying out format transformations on attribute values, for example so that names or phone numbers are represented consistently. Recent research has developed techniques for synthesizing format transformation programs from examples of the source and target representations. This is valuable, but still requires a user to provide suitable examples, something that may be challenging in applications in which there are huge datasets or numerous data sources. In this paper, we investigate the automatic discovery of examples that can be used to synthesize format transformation programs. In particular, we propose two approaches to identifying candidate data examples and validating the transformations that are synthesized from them. The approaches are evaluated empirically using datasets from open government data. © 2018 The British Computer Society. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {In this paper we propose a computational approach that applies data mining techniques to analyze the citizen participation recorded in an online digital platform. Differently to previous work, the approach exploits external knowledge extracted from Open Government Data for processing the citizens’ proposals and debates of the platform, enabling to characterize targeted issues and problems, and analyze the levels of discussion, support and controversy raised by the proposals. As a result of our analysis, we derive a number of insights and conclusions of interest and value for both citizens and government stakeholders in decision and policy making tasks. Among others, we show that proposals targeting issues that affect large majorities tend to be supported by citizens and ultimately implemented by the city council, but leave aside other very important issues affecting minority groups. Our study reveals that most controversial, likely relevant, problems do not always receive sufficient attention in e-participation. Moreover, it identifies several types of controversy, related to ideological and socioeconomic factors and political attitudes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

As the data-driven transparency model is exported and assumes an ascendant position around the globe, it is imperative that we ask what kind of publics, subjects, and indeed, politics it will produce. Open government data is not just a matter concerning accountability but is seen as a necessary component of the new ‘data economy’. To participate and benefit from this info-capitalist-democracy, the data subject is called upon to be both auditor and entrepreneur.

Inspired by Euclidean spectral distance metrics, this article derives three quality measures for modeling uncertainty in spectral information of open-source heterogeneous training samples for classification with Landsat imagery. We prepared eight test case data sets from volunteered geographic information and open government data sources to assess the proposed measures. The data sets have significant variations in quality, quantity, and data type. A correlation analysis verifies that the proposed measures can successfully rank the quality of heterogeneous training data sets prior to the image classification task. In this era of big data, preclassification quality assessment measures empower research scientists to select suitable data sets for classification tasks from available open data sources. Research findings prove the versatility of the Euclidean spectral distance function to develop quality metrics for assessing open-source training data sets with varying characteristics for urban area classification. © 2021 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.},

Individuals regularly interact with a variety of structured data, ranging from SQLite databases on the phone to personal sensors and open government data. The “digital traces left by individuals through these interactions” are sometimes referred to as “small data”. Examples of “small data” include driving records, biometric measurements, search histories, weather forecasts and usage alerts. In this paper, we present a flexible protocol called LoRaCTP, which is based on LoRa technology that allows data “chunks” to be transferred over large distances with very low energy expenditure. LoRaCTP provides all the mechanisms necessary to make LoRa transfer reliable by introducing a lightweight connection setup and allowing the ideal sending of an as-long-as necessary data message. We designed this protocol as communication support for small-data edge-based IoT solutions, given its stability, low power usage, and the possibility to cover long distances. We evaluated our protocol using various data content sizes and communication distances to demonstrate its performance and reliability. © 2021 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications},

    abstract = {Transparency is popularly believed to enhance the public's trust in government, yet experimental studies have found mixed results. One explanation is that public trust may respond more positively to a kind of “latent transparency” in which citizens highly value the mere potential for open access to government information, even if they may have more negative reactions when presented with the particular content of actual government information, documents, or data. To test this hypothesis, we designed two survey experiments in which samples of US adults were primed with general information about the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or the existence of open government data. Compared to controls, we find that awareness of FOIA rights and requirements (latent transparency) tended to be unrelated, or even slightly negatively related, to trust of government agencies, contrary to our expectations. Our findings, combined with prior evidence, suggest that—even in the case of latent transparency—the popular belief in transparency's positive effects on citizen trust needs a more critical examination. Implications for the theory and practice of transparency are discussed. © 2020 The Author(s)},

    abstract = {In Europe, an open government data ecosystem is being developed. This ecosystem is implemented using various technologies and platforms. In fact, the use of a common metadata standard for describing datasets and open data portals, i.e., the DCAT-AP specification, appears as the lingua franca that connects an, otherwise, fragmented environment. In this context, the standard-based consolidation of open data promotes the subsidiarity principle, allowing open data portal owners to choose platforms and internal representations based on their specific requirements. However, the portal owners must provide an export with DCAT-AP compliant metadata about the dataset they store. In this paper we provide a detailed study of how the DCAT-AP specification is used in practice, both at the national and the European level. Consequently, we also identify issues, challenges, and opportunities for improvements that can be used as input for the next revision cycle of the standard. Essentially, our goal is to contribute towards the enrichment of a growing and promising European open data ecosystem. Copyright © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

    abstract = {As an increasing number of open government data (OGD) portals are created, an evaluation method is needed to assess these portals. In this study, we drew from the existing principles and evaluation methods to develop a User Interaction Framework, with concrete criteria in five dimensions: Access, Trust, Understand, Engage-integrate, and Participate. The framework was then used to evaluate the current OGD sites created and maintained by 34 U.S. municipal government agencies. The results show that, overall, portals perform well in terms of providing access, but not so well in helping users understand and engage with data. These findings indicate room for improvement in multiple areas and suggest potential roles for information professionals as data mediators. The study also reveals that portals using the Socrata platform performed better, regarding user access, trust, engagement, and participation. However, the variability among portals indicates that some portals should improve their platforms to achieve greater user engagement and participation. In addition, city governments need to develop clear plans about what data should be available and how to make them available to their public. © 2018 ASIS&T},

To identify good practices, an integrative review was used, as well as procedures from the ProKnow-C methodology. After applying the ProKnow-C procedures to the documents retrieved from the Web of Science, Scopus and Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts databases, an analysis of 31 items was performed. This analysis allowed observing that in the last 20 years the guidelines for publishing open government data had a great impact on the Linked Data model implementation in several domains and currently the FAIR principles and the Data on the Web Best Practices are the most highlighted in the literature. These guidelines presents orientations in relation to various aspects for the publication of data in order to contribute to the optimization of quality, independent of the context in which they are applied. The CARE and FACT principles, on the other hand, although they were not formulated with the same objective as FAIR and the Best Practices, represent great challenges for information and technology scientists regarding ethics, responsibility, confidentiality, impartiality, security, and transparency of data. © 2023, Escola de Ciencia da Informacao da UFMG.

    abstract = {The Open Government Data portals (OGD), thanks to the presence of thousands of georeferenced datasets, containing spatial information are of extreme interest for any analysis or process relating to the territory. For this to happen, users must be enabled to access these datasets and reuse them. An element often considered as hindering the full dissemination of OGD data is the quality of their metadata. Starting from an experimental investigation conducted on over 160,000 geospatial datasets belonging to six national and international OGD portals, this work has as its first objective to provide an overview of the usage of these portals measured in terms of datasets views and downloads. Furthermore, to assess the possible influence of the quality of the metadata on the use of geospatial datasets, an assessment of the metadata for each dataset was carried out, and the correlation between these two variables was measured. The results obtained showed a significant underutilization of geospatial datasets and a generally poor quality of their metadata. In addition, a weak correlation was found between the use and quality of the metadata, not such as to assert with certainty that the latter is a determining factor of the former. © 2021 by the authors.

    abstract = {Software systems are increasingly depending on data, particularly with the rising use of machine learning, and developers are looking for new sources of data. Open Data Ecosystems (ODE) is an emerging concept for data sharing under public licenses in software ecosystems, similar to Open Source Software (OSS). It has certain similarities to Open Government Data (OGD), where public agencies share data for innovation and transparency. We aimed to explore open data ecosystems involving commercial actors. Thus, we organized five focus groups with 27 practitioners from 22 companies, public organizations, and research institutes. Based on the outcomes, we surveyed three cases of emerging ODE practice to further understand the concepts and to validate the initial findings. The main outcome is an initial conceptual model of ODEs’ value, intrinsics, governance, and evolution, and propositions for practice and further research. We found that ODE must be value driven. Regarding the intrinsics of data, we found their type, meta-data, and legal frameworks influential for their openness. We also found the characteristics of ecosystem initiation, organization, data acquisition and openness be differentiating, which we advise research and practice to take into consideration. © 2021 The Author(s)},

    abstract = {– This study is a systematic review that intends to improve our knowledge of the ideas of open data synchronization and standardization by reviewing the methodology and instruments utilized in previous studies through a careful examination of accessible literature. The methodology of this study was developed in several key phases. Firstly, a search was conducted in electronic databases to identify relevant studies in the field for Open Government Data (OGD). After identifying the studies, they were carefully reviewed through an initial abstract-based screening process. In the next phase, the research design and sample used in each identified study were analyzed to assess their quality and reliability. Subsequently, data from the studies were analyzed and categorized into various categories, including the usability of open data, synchronization, scalability, and reliability. The gained results highlight the importance of open data in our information-driven society. Open data positively impact transparency, anti-corruption efforts, and free access to information. To achieve these benefits, it is crucial to standardize and license open data, giving priority to their usability. The study underscores the importance of open data for transparency, innovation, and citizen engagement. Despite the disadvantages, this technology has the potential to change how governments and society use data. © 2024 Besart Hyseni & Lejla Abazi Bexheti; published by UIKTEN.

    abstract = {Open data are currently a hot topic and are associated with realising ambitions such as a more transparent and efficient government, solving societal problems, and increasing economic value. To describe and monitor the state of open data in countries and organisations, several open data assessment frameworks were developed. Despite high scores in these assessment frameworks, the actual (re)use of open government data (OGD) fails to live up to its expectations. Our review of existing open data assessment frameworks reveals that these only cover parts of the open data ecosystem. We have developed a framework, which assesses open data supply, open data governance, and open data user characteristics holistically. This holistic open data framework assesses the maturity of the open data ecosystem and proves to be a useful tool to indicate which aspects of the open data ecosystem are successful and which aspects require attention. Our initial assessment in the Netherlands indicates that the traditional geographical data perform significantly better than non-geographical data, such as healthcare data. Therefore, open geographical data policies in the Netherlands may provide useful cues for other OGD strategies. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

It serves as a foundation for novel technologies, such as big data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, to take root and flourish, and it can help improve the quality and efficiency of government decision making and render governments more transparent and accessible to the public. Often referred as Open Government Data, or OGD, governments around the world have committed resources to constructing various OGD platforms. However, building a robust and effective OGD system has proved difficult, as the promise of OGD has not been realized fully around the world. At this important juncture, this study aims to explore the relationship between national technological and organizational capacities and environmental factor and the quality of OGD systems. In addition, national innovativeness and the degree of “globalization” in a country and their moderating effects between the predictors and OGD performance are examined. Our findings indicate strong positive effects of national technological capacity, government organization capacity, and globalization on OGD quality and a positive moderating effect of national innovativeness. © 2021 by the authorsLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

    abstract = {Opendata efforts have now become a global movement, and Japan intends to
keep up with this global trend. Measures concerning open data have been
undertaken since the Open Government Data Strategy was adopted in July
2012. As a result, all 47 Japanese prefectures had developed Web pages
for their own open data by March in 2018. However, only 18.3\% of
municipalities had their open data released on the Internet. In this
paper, we investigate how deeply opendata efforts have penetrated into
local municipalities, not just the national average in Japan. By
analyzing the opendata disparities, we then infer the factors that have
facilitated opendata initiatives in local governments. We introduce an
opendata penetration ratell for each prefecture, calculating it by using
the number of municipalities that have already published their own open
data, and we find that there is a regional disparity in the opendata
efforts. By adding qualitative information to this quantitative
research, we have found that there are three types of collaborations
among the local governments that have already published open data. On
the basis of these findings, we discuss which type of collaboration is
the most promising for small-sized municipalities.},

The specific case aims to investigate the usability of open government data on occupancy in combination with third-party data on online audiences’ engagement for DMOs’ potential seasonal geotargeting via utilizing Openrouteservice’s APIs. For the pilot case, a Slovak (Central Europe) destination’s data on occupancy, and the DMO’s website and social media engagement by origin were used to determine potential audiences’ accessibility by car. Testing of the pilot results on a sample of foreign markets indicates that by a partial mix of the means of transportation, the vast majority of audiences are within a 4 h long incoming trip. Although the preliminary tests indicate a linear correlation between the destination’s occupancy and online audiences’ share accessibility by car, for further extrapolation, the list of missing input remains long. The main addition to the field of tourism and destination management may be the partial reusability of developed techniques for data extraction, and transformation for further data overlays, which may save some time. © 2023 by the authors.},

    abstract = {Maintaining physical activity is necessary to promote health in our daily lives. The Ecological Model of Active Living was proposed to examine whether individuals participate in active living. The purpose of this study was to understand the determinants of physical activity and create a predictive path model of the intrapersonal, perceived environment, behavior settings, and policy environment domains. Data were obtained from open government data and questionnaires, including the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Health Belief Model Inventory, Physical Activity Neighborhood Environment Survey, and Accessibility of Open Spaces. Participants comprised 1085 healthy adults who completed a self-reported internet survey. An analysis of the intrapersonal domain revealed that the variables of female, an older age, and a low educational level, and individuals with obesity or cardiometabolic diseases presented lower odds ratios for active living. We found significant statistical support for our path model (The Ecological Model of Active Living), with a predictive power of 23.1%. The predictive path model is a good approach to quantitatively measure the impacts of various determinants on active living that suggests further lines of research in approaches for modeling relationships. © 2019 Yen, Li.

In contrast to the view of big corporations promoting holistic “smart city in a box” solutions, this work proposes that smarter cities can be achieved by combining already available infrastructure, i.e., Open Government Data and sensor networks deployed in cities, with the citizens’ active contributions towards city knowledge by means of their smartphones and the apps executed in them. In addition, this work introduces the main characteristics of the IES Cities platform, whose goal is to ease the generation of citizen-centric apps that exploit urban data in different domains. The proposed vision is achieved by providing a common access mechanism to the heterogeneous data sources offered by the city, which reduces the complexity of accessing the city's data whilst bringing citizens closely to a prosumer (double consumer and producer) role and allowing to integrate legacy data into the cities’ data ecosystem. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

However, it is still difficult to discover and combine Open Statistical Data that reside in different data portals. Although Linked Open Statistical Data (LOSD) provide standards and approaches to facilitate combining statistics on the Web, various interoperability challenges still exist. In this paper, we propose an Interoperability Framework for LOSD, comprising definitions of LOSD interoperability conflicts as well as modelling practices currently used by six official open government data portals. Towards this end, we combine a top-down approach that studies interoperability conflicts in the literature with a bottom-up approach that studies the modelling practices of data portals. We define two types of LOSD schema-level conflicts, namely naming conflicts and structural conflicts. Naming conflicts result from using different URIs. Structural conflicts result from different practices of modelling the structure of data cubes. Only two out of the 19 conflicts are currently resolved and 11 can be resolved according to literature. © 2019 by the authors.},

    abstract = {Based on the 1978 Alma-Ata Declaration, the key to achieving health for all is primary health care, and many countries have established various comprehensive health care systems. Be-cause of the financial toll of a public health care system, government-sponsored public health insurance is not universally accepted. This study used Taiwan as the backdrop to understand why many health clinics have chosen not to accept the National Health Insurance (NHI), despite it covering 99.93% of the country’s population. The clinics’ operational details were garnered from the datasets of Taiwan’s open government data platforms and checked against the list of contracting clinics within the NHI. Of 10,907 Western medicine primary care clinics in 2016, as many as 9846 (90.3%) clinics had signed contracts with the NHI. The remaining 1061 noncontracting clinics were distrib-uted in urban (94.5%, n = 1003), suburban (4.9%, n = 52), and rural/remote areas (0.6%, n = 6). The NHI did not have contracts with 183 plastic surgery, 88 internal medicine, and 85 surgery clinics. In conclusion, nearly one-tenth of clinics practiced independently of the NHI in Taiwan. Their reasons for declining the contract and practices for delivering their services deserve further studies. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

    abstract = {The wave of government data opening has gradually swept the world since it rose from the United States in 2009. The purpose is not to open government data, but to release data value and drive economic and social development through data accessibility. At present, the impact of academic circles on government open data mostly stays in theoretical discussion, especially due to the lack of empirical tests. Using the multistage difference-in-difference (DID) model, this paper analyzes the panel data from 2009 to 2016 by taking two batches of Chinese cities with open data released in 2014 and 2105 as samples to test the impact of government data opening on urban innovation ability. The results show that the opening of government data significantly improves urban innovation abilities. After considering the heterogeneity and fixed effects of urban characteristics, the opening of government data still significantly improves urban innovation ability and shows a greater innovation driving role in cities with high levels of economic development, human capital, and infrastructure. Based on this, this paper believes that we should continue to promote the opening of government data, release the value of data, and pay attention to the Matthew effect between cities that may appear in the era of big data. © 2021 by the authors.

    abstract = {Since 2019, the Korean government’s investments in making data more accessible to the public have grown by 337%. However, open government data, which should be accessible to everyone, are not entirely accessible to people with low vision, who represent an information-vulnerable class. Emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, decrease face-to-face encounters and inevitably increase untact encounters. Thus, the information gap experienced by low-vision people, who are underprivileged in terms of information, will be further widened, and they may consequently face various disadvantages. This study proposed visual communication design accessibility (VCDA) guidelines for people with low vision. Introduced screens enhanced by accessibility guidelines were presented to 16 people with low vision and 16 people with normal vision and the speed of visual information recognition was analyzed. No statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) was found due to the small sample size; however, this study’s results approached significance with improved visual recognition speed for people with low vision after adopting VCDA. As a result of the intervention, the visual information recognition speed of both normal and low-vision people improved. Thus, our results can help improve information recognition speed among people with normal and low vision. © 2023 by the authors.},

    abstract = {Open government data (open data) initiatives have been at the forefront of the strategy to make more transparent, responsive, and accountable government, and thereby lead to open innovation across the public and private sector. Governments around the world often understand that open data is disclosing their data to the public as much as possible and that open data success is the result of a data and technology-related endeavor rather than the result of organizational, institutional, and environmental attributes. According to the resource-based theory, however, managerial capability to mobilize tangible and intangible resources and deploy them in adequate places or processes under the leadership of capable leaders during the information technology (IT) project is a core factor leading to organizational performance such as open data success. In this vein, this study aims to analyze managerial factors as drivers and challenges of open data success from the resource-based theory. Findings illustrate that managerial factors are the driving forces that often boost or hinder open data success when institutional, socio-economic, and demographic factors are controlled. Discussion illustrates theoretical and practical implications for the managerial factors as drivers and challenges of open data success in terms of the comparison between technological determinism and the socio-technical perspective. © 2019 by the authors.

framework with the summary of studies, including aspects of digital
citizenship identified in each job. As a result, it was observed that
most of the research pointed problems which impact directly on the
exercise of citizenship. That's because, according to the researchers,
part of the initiatives in this theme is surrounded by a speech of
participation with no practical effects, with little or no influence on
the political decision-making process. On the other hand, were also
presented studies that demonstrated the consolidation and the trend of
the use of open government data for a new model of digital governance,
which represents a major breakthrough for digital citizenship in Brazil.},

    abstract = {Transparency is today considered as a key feature of good governance. Almost undisputed, the concept has gained importance in both academic and practitioners’ circles due to its strong intrinsic and/or instrumental value. Recent years have seen the emergence of the open-data movement and its growing impact on government policies. Nevertheless, evidence related to impacts on transparency remains fragmented. This study aims to contribute to the field of research on transparency and open data by providing a conceptual clarification and by showing how both concepts are related and perceived in the Swiss public administration. This allows avoiding further confusion and better understanding the relation between the two notions. Moreover, this contribution also explores the implementation of the open-data logic in Switzerland. Although it does not participate in the Open Government Partnership, an international platform of 75 governments committed to making their activities more transparent, the country launched the federal Open Government Data project in 2015 with the aim of establishing an open-data culture within the administration. However, implementation of the open-data logic has been rather halting so far. Based on in-depth interviews conducted with civil servants in Switzerland, this contribution identifies four main types of barriers that impact on the uptake of open data in Switzerland: cultural, institutional, individual and economic. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

    abstract = {Data preparation, whether for populating enterprise data warehouses or as a precursor to more exploratory analyses, is recognised as being laborious, and as a result is a barrier to cost-effective data analysis. Several steps that recur within data preparation pipelines are amenable to automation, but it seems important that automated decisions can be refined in the light of user feedback on data products. There has been significant work on how individual data preparation steps can be refined in the light of feedback. This paper goes further, by proposing an approach in which feedback on the correctness of values in a data product can be used to revise the results of diverse data preparation components. The approach uses statistical techniques, both in determining which actions should be applied to refine the data preparation process and to identify the values on which it would be most useful to obtain further feedback. The approach has been implemented to refine the results of matching, mapping and data repair components in the VADA data preparation system, and is evaluated using deep web and open government data sets from the real estate domain. The experiments have shown how the approach enables feedback to be assimilated effectively for use with individual data preparation components, and furthermore that synergies result from applying the feedback to several data preparation components. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {In this era of 'big data', there is growing recognition of the value of environmental, health, social and demographic data for research. Open government data initiatives are growing in number and in terms of content. Remote sensing data are finding widespread use in environmental research, including in low- and middle-income settings. While our ability to study environment and health associations across countries and continents grows, data protection rules and greater patient control over the use of their data present new challenges to using health data in research. Innovative tools that circumvent the need for the physical sharing of data by supporting non-disclosive sharing of information, or that permit spatial analysis without researchers needing access to underlying patient data can be used to support analyses while protecting data confidentiality. User-friendly visualizations, allowing small-area data to be seen and understood by non-expert audiences, are revolutionizing public and researcher interactions with data. The UK Small Area Health Statistics Unit's Environment and Health Atlas for England and Wales, and the US National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network offer good examples. Open data facilitates user-generated outputs, and 'mash-ups', and user-generated inputs from social media, mobile devices and wearable tech are new data streams that will find utility in future studies, and bring novel dimensions with respect to ethical use of small-area data. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

    abstract = {Objective: The publication of data opened by the government has as its main objective or its reuse by society. As the increase in the volume of available data, machine processing was one of two essential requirements to promote interoperability, thus allowing the effective reuse of open government data. This data article aims to reveal the data collection process in the IBGE aggregate data API, which makes available aggregate data from surveys and censuses carried out in Brazil. Method: This research is characterized as descriptive and exploratory, with a qualitative, and applied approach because it involves a practical problem that collects two data in the IBGE aggregate data API. For this reason, a documentary search was carried out to identify the broken points (endpoints) available and the parameters existing in the API, which will allow the implementation of “filters” to recover data and relevant information in a universe with many sets of aggregated data. Reuse potential: The availability of two sets of IBGE research data, in an automated manner, allows them to be monitored, recovered and used in the direction and maintenance of public policies, contributing to the identification of patterns, behaviors and habits of the population, by various segments of civil society, including companies (public and private), promoting new digital business models that use data and information from different contexts, creating new products, services and occupations. © 2023, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

    abstract = {Background: Data scientists spend considerable amounts of time preparing data for analysis. Data preparation is labour intensive because the data scientist typically takes fine grained control over each aspect of each step in the process, motivating the development of techniques that seek to reduce this burden. Results: This paper presents an architecture in which the data scientist need only describe the intended outcome of the data preparation process, leaving the software to determine how best to bring about the outcome. Key wrangling decisions on matching, mapping generation, mapping selection, format transformation and data repair are taken by the system, and the user need only provide: (i) the schema of the data target; (ii) partial representative instance data aligned with the target; (iii) criteria to be prioritised when populating the target; and (iv) feedback on candidate results. To support this, the proposed architecture dynamically orchestrates a collection of loosely coupled wrangling components, in which the orchestration is declaratively specified and includes self-tuning of component parameters. Conclusion: This paper describes a data preparation architecture that has been designed to reduce the cost of data preparation through the provision of a central role for automation. An empirical evaluation with deep web and open government data investigates the quality and suitability of the wrangling result, the cost-effectiveness of the approach, the impact of self-tuning, and scalability with respect to the numbers of sources. © 2019, The Author(s).},

    abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyze conditions of success in Open
Data through the case study of the Central Bank of Brazil (BC), an
institution that stands out in the Open Data Policy within the federal
government. The study examines the state of the art in complying with
the Open Data Policy on Federal Public Administration and how the BC was
able to overcome obstacles common obstacles to the Federal Public
Administration (APF). The theoretical framework discusses the concepts
of transparency and open government data, in their potential and
limitations. To counterpoint the BC experience -based on bibliographic
research, document analysis and nine semi-structured interviews -an
ideal type of federal institutions on the PDAEF was built. The main
findings were: (i) the culture of transparency disseminated at BC
enabled greater acceptance of data-opening regulations and less
resistance to the institution's Open Data Plan, while in other federal
agencies, culture of transparency does not yet seem to be sufficiently
widespread; (ii) the performance of key employees in BC's data opening
process was of great relevance to its policy's success. In contrast,
high turnover in the Federal Public Administration proved to be a
hindrance to Open Data; (iii) Top management support and institutional
engagement also proved to be factors that favored the Open Data Policy
at Central Bank, however, the issue does not yet seem to be properly
addressed in many federal institutions.},

    abstract = {Informal green spaces (IGS) are the overlooked and unplanned green
spaces in our cities. They have been shown provide a potentially
important social and ecological green space asset through contributing
to ecological habitat and connectivity, as well as green space
accessibility for urban residents. Despite their potential value to
urban social -ecological systems, IGS are often overlooked and forgotten
in urban planning policy. However, before we can think about how best to
govern these spaces, we must first know where they are. This paper
proposes a method to spatially locate IGS in a practical and resource
sensitive way. We outline a method that uses an overlay analysis of open
government data to map IGS at a high resolution and at a landscape scale
based on key socialecological characteristics. The method was applied to
a case study in the City of Darebin, Melbourne, Australia, and evaluated
through an onsite validation process. Results indicate that the method
accurately predicted the location of IGS within the urban environment
with an accuracy of 83\%. This mapping method has several useful
applications both within the Melbourne and Australian contexts, as well
as potential application globally. These include enabling future
research into how IGS contribute to urban social -ecological systems, as
well as enabling land use decision makers seeking to better understand
the abundance and nature of IGS sites they manage and how they may
govern these spaces in a more informed way.},

    abstract = {We develop the concept of ‘aesthetic practices’ to capture the work needed for population data to be disseminated via government data portals. Specifically, we look at the Census Hub of the European Statistical System and the Danish Ministry of Education’s Data Warehouse. These portals form part of open government data initiatives, which we understand as governing technologies. We argue that to function as such, aesthetic practices are required so that data produced at dispersed sites can be brought into relation and projected as populations in forms such as bar charts, heat maps and tables. Two examples of aesthetic practices are analysed based on ethnographic studies we have conducted on the production of data for the Hub and Warehouse: metadata and data cleaning. Metadata enables data to come into relation by containing and accounting for (some of) the differences between data. Data cleaning deals with the indeterminacies and absences of data and involves algorithms to determine what values data can obtain so they can be brought into relation. We attend to how both aesthetic practices involve normative decisions that make absent what exceeds them: embodied knowledge that cannot or has not been documented as well as data that cannot meet the forms required of data portals. While these aesthetic practices are necessary to sustain data portals as ‘sites of projection,’ we also bring critical attention to their performative effects for knowing, enacting and governing populations. © The Author(s) 2019.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The study aims to promote independent mobility for persons with visual impairment or legal blindness (VIB) by developing a Web-based wayfinding application using geographic information systems (GIS). While the literature mainly focuses on technical devices presenting results for wayfinding, a lack of integration of user needs is identified. The inclusive, participative developed application offers step-by-step directions for pre-trip planning through an accessible user interface. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a semi-automated approach to extract a pedestrian routing network data set based on open government data and field survey. User profiles calculate different routes using a weighting scheme for landmarks, orientation hints, infrastructure of crossings and sidewalks. The adoption of ArcGIS Web AppBuilder widgets allows access of the user interface additionally through keyboard-only navigation and therefore screen-reader capability. Findings: GIS offers a powerful tool to design network analysis for persons with VIB. The routing algorithm accesses different user profiles, returning individualized turn-by-turn directions. The complex set of attributes, including shorelines, landmarks and barriers, can be integrated by semi-automated processes. Practical implications: The paper illustrates the benefit of GIS applications for wayfinding of persons with VIB to raise self-determination and independence. Originality/value: A ubiquitous pedestrian sidewalk network for a medium-size city comprises a novelty, as research has mainly focused on small areas. The integration of shorelines next to a various number of hints, landmarks and potential barriers through semi-automated processes allows reproducibility and transferability of the model to other cities. © 2021, Susanne Zimmermann-Janschitz, Simon Landauer, Sebastian Drexel and Jana Obermeier.},

    abstract = {Introduction: The escalation in the opening of government data is a phenomenon originated from extensive debates about the modernization of the State, combined with technological evolution. In the literature, there is a lack of scientific research of a theoretical and practical nature that presents more updated scenarios regarding initiatives to open government data, mainly in actions to organize information in this segment, both in Brazil and abroad. This article aims to present the background and historical movement of data opening, in addition to the current panorama of initiatives in some continental countries, showing relevant stages and contributions to the discussions on challenges and opportunities for their governments. Method: It is qualitative, exploratory and descriptive research using bibliographic and documentary research techniques for a systematic review of government open data scenarios both in Brazil and in other international spheres. Results: The theoretical and methodological contributions of Information and Computer Sciences are highlighted in the main challenges mapped in the research, in addition to the decline of nations such as the USA and the United Kingdom, former leaders of the movement, and the rise of new protagonists, such as Korea South, France, Ireland and Spain, also presenting the current Brazilian scenario. Conclusion: The article shows that one of the main successes in data opening concerns the way governments are dealing with Government Open Data Policy and those internal aspects of governance are affecting the publication of data on the network, according to the precepts of the open movement recommended in the literature. © 2021 Macedo & Lemos.},

    abstract = {Data entry errors in large-scale public health surveys can undermine the
effectiveness of data-driven interventions. Therefore, identifying these
data entry errors is crucial for public health experts. In large-scale
public health surveys, manually verifying the accuracy of every data
point by domain experts is nearly impossible. This study evaluates
unsupervised machine learning algorithms for detecting these errors,
focusing on the `weight' parameter in the Annual Health Survey (AHS)
dataset. The AHS, conducted by the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare, Government of India, in collaboration with the Registrar
General of India, is a large-scale, stratified, household-level survey
targeting maternal and child health across nine states in India. The
dataset is freely available on the Open Government Data (OGD) Platform
of India for public health research. In this study, five
algorithms-DBSCAN, K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Isolation
Forest (IF), and One-Class SVM (1C-SVM) were applied to detect erroneous
data entries. The evaluation process involved comprehensive
preprocessing and feature engineering to optimize detection
capabilities. Performance metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy,
false anomaly, and missed anomaly rates were used to assess each
algorithm. Among these, DBSCAN demonstrated superior performance,
achieving a recall of 94.7\% and a precision of 81.9\%, making it highly
effective for this task. The findings underscore the potential of
unsupervised machine learning in automating the detection of data entry
errors, thereby improving the integrity of public health data. This
research contributes to the advancement of precision public health,
supporting more accurate and reliable evidence-based decision-making and
policy formulation.},

    abstract = {Background: Governments around the world own multiple datasets related to the policy domain of health. Datasets range from vaccination rates to the availability of health care practitioners in a region to the outcomes of certain surgeries. Health is believed to be a promising subject in the case of open government data policies. However, the specific properties of health data such as its sensibilities regarding privacy, ethics, and ownership encompass particular conditions either enabling or preventing datasets to become freely and easily accessible for everyone. Objective and methods: This paper aims to map the ecosystem of open health data. By analyzing the foundations of health data and the commonalities of open data ecosystems via literature analysis, the socio-technical environment in which health data managed by governments are opened up or potentially stay closed is created. After its theoretical development, the open health data ecosystem is tested via a case study concerning the Data for Better Health initiative from the government of Belgium. Results: Creation and assessment of an open health data ecosystem consisting of stakeholders, interests, information policies, and data preparation activities. Conclusions: The policy domain of health includes de-identification activities, bioethical assessments, and the specific role of data providers within its open data ecosystem. However, the concept of open data does not always fully apply to the topic of health. Such several health datasets may be findable via government portals but not directly accessible. Differentiation within types of health data and data user capacities are recommendable for future research. © The Author(s) 2021.},

    abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) reflects the socioeconomic
development of a nation. The IMR was reduced by 28\% between 2015 and
2016 (National Family Health Survey-4 {[}NFHS-4]) as compared to
2005-2006 (NFHS-3), from 57/1000 to 41/1000 live births. The target
fixed by the Government of India for IMR in 2019 is 28/1000 live births
(National Health Policy, 2017). One of the most common methods of
forecasting this is the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
model. A forecast of IMR can help implementation of interventions to
reduce the burden of infant mortality within the target range.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The objective of the study was to give a detailed
explanation of ARIMA model to forecast the IMR (2017-2025). Secondary
data analysis and forecast were done for the available year and IMR data
extracted from ``open government data platform India{''} website.
RESULTS: The forecast of the sample period (1971-2016) showed accuracy
by the selected ARIMA (2, 1, 1) model. The postsample forecast with
ARIMA (2, 1, 1) showed a decreasing trend of IMR (2017-2025). The
forecast IMR for 2025 is 15/1000 live births.
CONCLUSION: In the current study, long-time series IMR data were used to
forecast the IMR for 9 years. The data showed that IMR would decline
from 33/1000 live births in 2017 to 15/1000 live births in 2025. When
the actual data for another year (2017) are available, the model can be

    abstract = {Background: Government agencies in the United States are creating mobile
health (mHealth) apps as part of recent policy changes initiated by the
White House's Digital Government Strategy.
Objective: The objective of the study was to understand the
institutional and managerial barriers for the implementation of mHealth,
as well as the resulting adoption pathways of mHealth.
Methods: This article is based on insights derived from qualitative
interview data with 35 public managers in charge of promoting the reuse
of open data through Challenge. gov, the platform created to run prizes,
challenges, and the vetting and implementation of the winning and
vendor-created apps.
Results: The process of designing apps follows three different pathways:
(1) entrepreneurs start to see opportunities for mobile apps, and
develop either in-house or contract out to already vetted Web design
vendors; (2) a top-down policy mandates agencies to adopt at least two
customer-facing mobile apps; and (3) the federal government uses a
policy instrument called ``Prizes and Challenges{''}, encouraging civic
hackers to design health-related mobile apps using open government data
from HealthData. gov, in combination with citizen needs. All pathways of
the development process incur a set of major obstacles that have to be
actively managed before agencies can promote mobile apps on their
websites and app stores.
Conclusions: Beyond the cultural paradigm shift to design interactive
apps and to open health-related data to the public, the managerial
challenges include accessibility, interoperability, security, privacy,
and legal concerns using interactive apps tracking citizen.},

    abstract = {Understanding cities as complex systems, sustainable urban planning depends on reliable high-resolution data, for example of the building stock to upscale region-wide retrofit policies. For some cities and regions, these data exist in detailed 3D models based on real-world measurements. However, they are still expensive to build and maintain, a significant challenge, especially for small and medium-sized cities that are home to the majority of the European population. New methods are needed to estimate relevant building stock characteristics reliably and cost-effectively. Here, we present a machine learning based method for predicting building heights, which is based only on open-access geospatial data on urban form, such as building footprints and street networks. The method allows to predict building heights for regions where no dedicated 3D models exist currently. We train our model using building data from four European countries (France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany) and find that the morphology of the urban fabric surrounding a given building is highly predictive of the height of the building. A test on the German state of Brandenburg shows that our model predicts building heights with an average error well below the typical floor height (about 2.5 m), without having access to training data from Germany. Furthermore, we show that even a small amount of local height data obtained by citizens substantially improves the prediction accuracy. Our results illustrate the possibility of predicting missing data on urban infrastructure; they also underline the value of open government data and volunteered geographic information for scientific applications, such as contextual but scalable strategies to mitigate climate change. © 2020 Milojevic-Dupont et al.

    abstract = {In the rapidly evolving field of real estate economics, the prediction
of house prices continues to be a complex challenge, intricately tied to
a multitude of socio-economic factors. Traditional predictive models
often overlook spatial interdependencies that significantly influence
housing prices. The objective of this study is to leverage Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) on open statistics knowledge graphs to model these
spatial dependencies and predict house prices across Scotland's 2011
data zones. The methodology involves retrieving integrated statistical
indicators from the official Scottish Open Government Data portal and
applying three representative GNN algorithms: ChebNet, GCN, and
GraphSAGE. These GNNs are compared against traditional models, including
the tabular-based XGBoost and a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
demonstrating superior prediction accuracy. Innovative contributions of
this study include the use of GNNs to model spatial dependencies in real
estate economics and the application of local and global explainability
techniques to enhance transparency and trust in the predictions. The
global feature importance is determined by a logistic regression
surrogate model while the local, region-level understanding of the GNN
predictions is achieved through the use of GNNExplainer. Explainability
results are compared with those from a previous work that applied the
XGBoost machine learning algorithm and the SHapley Additive exPlanations
(SHAP) explainability framework on the same dataset. Interestingly, both
the global surrogate model and the SHAP approach underscored the
comparative illness factor, a health indicator, and the ratio of
detached dwellings as the most crucial features in the global
explainability. In the case of local explanations, while both methods
showed similar results, the GNN approach provided a richer, more
comprehensive understanding of the predictions for two specific data
zones.},

    abstract = {Anticipating and planning for the urgent response to large-scale disasters is critical to increase the probability of survival at these events. These incidents present various challenges that complicate the response, such as unfavorable weather conditions, difficulties in accessing affected areas, and the geographical spread of the victims. Furthermore, local socioeconomic factors, such as inadequate prevention education, limited disaster resources, and insufficient coordination between public and private emergency services, can complicate these situations. In large-scale emergencies, multiple demand points (DPs) are generally observed, which requires efforts to coordinate the strategic allocation of human and material resources in different geographical areas. Therefore, the precise management of these resources based on the specific needs of each area becomes fundamental. To address these complexities, this paper proposes a methodology that models these scenarios as a multi-objective optimization problem, focusing on the location-allocation problem of resources in Mass Casualty Incidents (MCIs). The proposed case study is Mexico City in a earthquake post-disaster scenario, using voluntary geographic information, open government data, and historical data from the 19 September 2017 earthquake. It is assumed that the resources that require optimal location and allocation are ambulances, which focus on medical issues that affect the survival of victims. The designed solution involves the use of a metaheuristic optimization technique, along with a parameter tuning technique, to find configurations that perform at different instances of the problem, i.e., different hypothetical scenarios that can be used as a reference for future possible situations. Finally, the objective is to present the different solutions graphically, accompanied by relevant information to facilitate the decision-making process of the authorities responsible for the practical implementation of these solutions. © 2024 by the authors.},

    abstract = {Introduction. Open Government is a form of public policy based on the pillars of collaboration and citizen participation, transparency and the right of access to public information. With the help of information and communication technologies, governments and administrations carry out open data initiatives, making reusable datasets available to all citizens. The academic community, highly qualified personnel, can become potential reusers of this data, which would lead to its use for scientific research, generating knowledge, and for teaching, improving the training of university students and promoting the reuse of open data in the future. Method. This study was developed using a quantitative research methodology (survey), which was distributed by email in one context block and six technical blocks, with a total of 30 questions. The data collection period was between 15 March and 10 May 2021. Analysis. The data obtained through this quantitative methodology were processed, normalised, and analysed. Results. A total of 783 responses were obtained, from 34 Spanish provinces. The researchers come from 47 Spanish universities and 21 research centres, and 19 research areas of the State Research Agency are represented. In addition, a platform was developed with the data for the purpose of visualising the results of the survey. Conclusions. The sample thus obtained is representative and the conclusions can be extrapolated to the rest of the Spanish university teaching staff. In terms of gender, the study is balanced between men and women (41.76% W vs. 56.58% M). In general, researchers responding to the survey know what open data is (79.31%) but only 50.57% reuse open data. The main conclusion is that open government data prove to be useful sources of information for science, especially in areas such as Social Sciences, Industrial Production, Engineering and Engineering for Society, Information and Communication Technologies, Economics and Environmental Sciences. © 2024 by the authors.},

    abstract = {Population growth will confront the City of Zurich with a variety of challenges in the coming years, as the increase in the number of inhabitants and jobs will lead to densification and competing land uses. The tasks for the city administration have become more complex, whereas tools and methods are often based on traditional, static approaches while involving a limited number of citizens and stakeholders in relevant decisions. The digital transformation of more and more pieces of the planning and decision-making process will make both increasingly more illustrative, easier to understand and more comprehensible. An important data basis for these processes is the digital twin of the City of Zurich. 3D spatial data and their models transform themes of the city, such as buildings, bridges, vegetation, etc., to the digital world, are being updated when required, and create advantages in digital space. These benefits need to be highlighted and published. An important step in public awareness is the release of 3D spatial data under Open Government Data. This allows the development of applications, the promotion of understanding, and the simplification of the creation of different collaborative platforms. By visualization and analysis of digital prototypes and the demonstration of interactions with the built environment, scenarios can be digitally developed and discussed in decision-making bodies. Questions about the urban climate can be simulated with the help of the digital twin and results can be linked to the existing 3D spatial data. Thus, the 3D spatial data set, the models and their descriptions through metadata become the reference and must be updated according to the requirements. Depending on requirements and questions, further 3D spatial data must be added. The description of the 3D spatial data and their models or the lifecycle management of the digital twin must be carried out with great care. Only in this way, decision processes can be supported in a comprehensible way. © 2020, The Author(s).},

    abstract = {Background: The shortage and distribution of nurses affect healthcare access in aging societies. Limited research has explored the nursing workforce in clinics, which is vital for healthcare delivery. This study aimed to investigate the shortage and distribution of nurses in clinics in Taiwan, considering geographical, institutional, and specialty variations. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the national nursing workforce in Western medicine clinics in Taiwan using open government data. The nursing practice rate (NPR) was calculated. The ratio of clinics employing nurses (RCN) was determined by calculating the percentage of clinics with nurses in each category. A logistic regression model was fitted to examine the factors associated with nurse employment, including urbanization level and different specialty clinics. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs were calculated. Results: The study revealed an overall NPR as low as 59.1%, and a decreasing trend with age. Among the 11 706 clinics in the study, nearly a quarter did not employ nurses, with an overall RCN of 72.3%. Urbanization level and clinic specialty were associated with nurse employment (p < 0.05). After adjusting for urbanization level, the fitted regression model identified the top three specialties as plastic surgery (OR = 11.37, RCN = 96.8%), internal medicine (OR = 1.94, RCN = 84.1%), and orthopedics (OR = 1.89, RCN = 83.6%), while the bottom three were otolaryngology (OR = 0.59, RCN = 61.5%), psychiatry (OR = 0.49, RCN = 57.1%), and rehabilitation medicine (OR = 0.30, RCN = 45.2%). Nurses were more likely to be employed in areas at urbanization level 1 (OR = 1.17), 3 (OR = 1.37), and 6 (OR = 1.48), which represent highly urbanized areas within the urban, suburban, and rural categories, respectively, than in urbanization level 4. Conclusion: Clinics in Taiwan showed nursing shortages and maldistribution, with 72.3% RCN and variations based on urbanization and specialty. These factors may be considered in nursing research conducted in other countries to inform future workforce planning. © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {Due to the wide-ranging development of data-oriented sustainable systems in the government and the public sectors, the development of such sustainable systems is replete with potential. The ultimate focus of developing these sustainable systems is to provide citizens with transparency, accountability, awareness as well as a single point of query for asking integrated and smart queries. In view of these benefits, the Saudi government has taken the initiative to publish and develop sustainable open data-oriented information systems. However some major challenges in the Saudi Government Open Data are that the (1) data are published and available in different formats such as Excel sheets, CSV files (Comma Separated Values), images, scanned documents and social media sources such as Twitter, (2) datasets from different government departments are not linked with each other or to existing datasets in Linked Open Data Cloud (even though they have strong links with each other), and (3) there is no SPARQL Endpoint that can be used to pose smart semantic-based queries to Saudi Government Data. This paper is part of an ongoing research project to present a framework that can be used to transfer the government data from different sources to RDF format. The framework can also be used to clean and classify/map the data according to the Saudi Government Ontology. We also describe our approach for semiautomatically linking Saudi Government Datasets with one another as well as with other existing open datasets, thus resulting in the Saudi Linked Open Government Data Cloud (SLOGDC). Finally, taking the topic “Public’s Response to Women’s Driving in Saudi Arabia” as a case study, we demonstrate the SLOGD SPARQL Endpoint as a data-oriented system by executing different queries and analyzing results of these queries. This work also contributes new insights into women’s driving in Saudi Arabia using the SLOGDC, thus suggesting the way forward in shaping policies for decision-making. © 2020 by the authors.

    abstract = {Background: Accessibility to surgical services can impact earthquake preparedness and response. We aimed to estimate the population with timely access to surgical care in Guerrero, a Mexican state with high tectonic activity, and identify populations at risk in the event of an earthquake. Methods: We conducted an ecological study using open government data. We extracted data from Guerrero municipalities regarding their earthquake risk, social vulnerability, social inequality, marginalisation, and resilience indices. The latest combines municipalities’ resistance to unexpected events and capacity to maintain optimal functionality without immediate federal or international support. Geographical coordinates of active public and private surgical facilities in Guerrero were combined with ancillary spatial data on roads and municipalities' population density to estimate population coverage within 30-min and 1-h driving time to surgical facilities in Redivis. We built an ordered beta regression model for each driving time estimate. Findings: We identified 25 public and 16 private facilities capable of providing surgical care in Guerrero. The population with access to facilities with surgical capacity within 30 min and 1-h driving times were 48.4% and 69.1%, respectively. We found that municipalities with very high levels of earthquake risk, social vulnerability, social inequality, and marginalisation, and very low levels of resilience had decreased coverage. In the multivariable analysis, the resilience index was statistically significant only for the 30-min model, with an effect size of 0.524 (95% CI 0.082, 1.089). Interpretation: Access to surgical care remains unequally distributed in Guerrero municipalities at the highest risk for earthquakes. Municipalities' resilience was the most significant predictor of higher surgical care coverage in 30-min driving time. Our study provides insights on how surgical system strengthening can enhance earthquake emergency disaster planning. Funding: No funding. © 2023},

    abstract = {Background: Socioeconomic status (SES) is an important determinant of health, and SES data is an important confounder to control for in epidemiology and health services research. Individual level SES measures are cumbersome to collect and susceptible to biases, while area level SES measures may have insufficient granularity. The ‘Singapore Housing Index’ (SHI) is a validated, building level SES measure that bridges individual and area level measures. However, determination of the SHI has previously required periodic data purchase and manual parsing. In this study, we describe a means of SHI determination for public housing buildings with open government data, and validate this against the previous SHI determination method. Methods: Government open data sources (e.g. data.gov.sg, Singapore Land Authority OneMAP API, Urban Redevelopment Authority API) were queried using custom Python scripts. Data on residential public housing block address and composition from the HDB Property Information dataset (data.gov.sg) was matched to postal code and geographical coordinates via OneMAP API calls. The SHI was calculated from open data, and compared to the original SHI dataset that was curated from non-open data sources in 2018. Results: Ten thousand seventy-seven unique residential buildings were identified from open data. OneMAP API calls generated valid geographical coordinates for all (100%) buildings, and valid postal code for 10,012 (99.36%) buildings. There was an overlap of 10,011 buildings between the open dataset and the original SHI dataset. Intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.999 for the two sources of SHI, indicating almost perfect agreement. A Bland-Altman plot analysis identified a small number of outliers, and this revealed 5 properties that had an incorrect SHI assigned by the original dataset. Information on recently transacted property prices was also obtained for 8599 (85.3%) of buildings. Conclusion: SHI, a useful tool for health services research, can be accurately reconstructed using open datasets at no cost. This method is a convenient means for future researchers to obtain updated building-level markers of socioeconomic status for policy and research. © The Author(s) 2021.},

    abstract = {Due to the complexity of socio-economic-related issues, people thought of housing market as a chaotic nucleus situated at the intersection of neighboring sciences. It has been known that the dependence of house features on the residential property value can be estimated employing the well-established hedonic regression analysis method in teams of location characteristic, neighborhood characteristic and structure characteristic. However, to further assess the roles of urban infrastructures in housing markets, we proposed a new kind of volatility measure for house prices utilizing the Lie symmetry analysis of quantum theory based on Schrödinger equation, mainly focusing on the effects of transportation systems and public parks on residential property values. Based on the municipal open government data regularly collected for four cities, including Boston, Milwaukee, Taipei and Tokyo, and all spatial sampling sites were featured by United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Map, transportation and park were modelled as perturbations to the quantum states generated by the feature space in response to the environmental amenities with different spatial extents. In an attempt to ascertain the intrinsic impact of the location-dependent price information obtained, the similarity functions associated with the Schrödinger equation were considered to facilitate revealing the city amenities capitalizing into house prices. By examining the spatial spillover phenomena of house prices in the four cities investigated, it was found that the mass transit systems and the public green lands possessed the infinitesimal generators of Lie point symmetries Y2 and Y5, respectively. Compared statistically with the common performance criteria, including mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE) and, root mean squared error (RMSE) obtained by hedonic pricing model, the Lie symmetry analysis of the Schrödinger equation approach developed herein was successfully carried out. The invariant-theoretical characterizations of economics-related phenomena are consonant with the observed residential property values of the cities internationally, ultimately leading to develop a new perspective in the global financial architecture. © 2021 Lin et al.

    abstract = {The concept of Society 5.0, first introduced by Japan in 2016, has become a widely accepted model for the development of social infrastructures across the world. It is a model which is expected to take root globally over the next few years. It is also a model which has smart cities, which are connected and inclusive, at its core. The role of open data is critical to smart cities, and the ability to design and implement strategies for its use is a crucial element in their growth and success. This requires a leadership and organisational culture that embraces the concept of open government data (OGD) and understands its key role in the development of smart cities. In this paper, we examine how the leadership and organisational culture in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Countries has impacted the progress of OGD initiatives and, therefore, the transition to smart cities. This is approached via a re-analysis of data from an earlier study in which semi-structured interviews were used to understand the views and attitudes of a range of senior government department personnel in OGD-related roles, where here a new thematic analysis seeks to identify clearer pointers to attitudes and practices directly relating to smart cities and Society 5.0. The focus on internal factors, such as leadership attitudes and organisational culture, as opposed to external factors, such as technology and resources, differentiates this research from previous studies and adds to our current knowledge. The findings lead to a discussion that identifies a likely gap in the leadership provided by more senior figures. A pilot study of a group of these leaders suggests a generalised problem with communication of policy, objectives and strategies, which is crucial to overcoming cultural impediments to smart city development. While further research is required, a need clearly emerges for significant changes in attitude and application at senior managerial and leadership levels if strategic goals are to be achieved. The paper also makes a number of specific recommendations for activities that could improve progress and indicate areas where more research would be beneficial. © 2023 by the authors.},

    abstract = {The number of ambient air quality monitoring stations is growing globally, driven by the need to quantify potential health risks posed by air pollution on urban populations. Reliable, robust and interoperable air quality monitoring requires observations with consistent accuracy and low amounts of missing data. In practice, this is challenging to achieve due to the measurement limitations and complexity of the physical phenomena. Data assimilation methods are widely used to fill missing or faulty observations and improve data quality by combining observations from fixed air quality monitoring ground stations with large-scale numerical models. A further advantage of data assimilation is that it can decrease costs by reusing existing open government data. A key requirement for assimilation is that uncertainty estimates are available for both measurements and model data. However, this poses a major bottleneck for widespread data assimilation with open data because uncertainty estimates are frequently unavailable. Additional challenges addressed in this work include the needs to impute missing data and process observations and model simulation results at different temporal and spatial scales. To address these challenges, we have developed novel, lightweight data assimilation algorithms based on recursive least-squares. The algorithms provide a fully data-driven way to estimate unknown uncertainties by defining the weights of the input data sources using least-squares data assimilation. The lightweight data assimilation algorithms can be executed to update the current state estimate in near real-time scenarios to improve the accuracy, completeness, and precision of the analysis estimate. A sensitivity analysis is conducted using synthetic data based on logistic maps with increasing noise levels. In addition, the proposed assimilation algorithms are applied to large-scale open pan-European air quality monitoring station data. The data were obtained from 86 stations for CO, 593 stations for NO2, 462 stations for O3, 137 stations for SO2, 254 stations for PM2.5, and 445 stations for PM10 in the period from 2022-01-27 01:00:00 to 2022-02-25 15:00:00 from the European Environmental Agency (EEA) and corresponding simulation results from the System for Integrated modeLling of Atmospheric composition (SILAM, global, version 5.7, FRC forecasts at the surface). The proposed lightweight data assimilation methods were found suitable to improve the completeness (filling in all missing data), accuracy (taken as the RMSE between the assimilation results and ground station observations) and precision for all of the open air quality parameters evaluated in this work. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight assimilation algorithms may also provide new and cost-effective methods to improve the data quality of the growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) urban air quality sensors.  © 2013 IEEE.},

    abstract = {Background: Children constitute a nation's true asset. A country's
future relies upon the proper development of its children, which
necessitates a supportive environment and sufficient opportunities.
Children, under the age of 18 years form a considerable percentage of
India's population which imparts a huge responsibility for the nation.
Everyday we come across news about a child going missing. The National
Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) states that 73,138 children were reported
missing overall in 2018. The prevalence increased by 8.9\% in 2019, a
worrisome situation. The cause behind children going missing is
multi-dimensional like poverty, unemployment, loss of livelihood,
natural calamities, social conflicts, and migration to urban areas. At
present, missing children remain a neglected and non-urgent intervention
area for everyone. Only the parents whose children are missing can feel
the vacuum and sorrow of the situation. The sociologies of India's
missing children merit dimensional and circumstantial examination. The
sociological space into which a child goes missing is highly
under-researched in India. This study helped in understanding the
magnitude of missing cases across India based on existing literature and
secondary sources. It also identified the potentially safe and worst
areas with regard to missing children. The endemicity helped in
identifying the changing trends in each of these areas of interest,
which could serve as baseline data for policymakers and law enforcement
alike.Materials and methods: This is a cross-sectional analytical type
of study. The data of missing and unrecovered children for the past five
years (2021-2017) were obtained from open government data portal
(https://data.gov.in) and geospatial hotspot analysis was done using the
Getis-Order-G statistics on the same using GeoPandas and PySAL libraries
of python. The endemicity of missing cases was studied using
hierarchical cluster analysis and self-organizing maps using
Python.Results: For boys, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh
remained consistent hotspots (high risk of missing cases) across all
five years of study whereas Karnataka became a hotspot for 2020 and
2021. Among the cold spots (low risk of missing cases), Andaman and
Nicobar Islands remained consistent cold spot across all five years of
study and has emerged as a safe haven for boys. The missing girls' data
reveals that Uttar Pradesh has consistently been the worst state for
girls (along with their neighbors) as it possess the risk of girls going
missing all through the study period with Chhattisgarh being included
from 2019 onwards. Jharkhand, Gujarat, Sikkim, and Andaman and Nicobar
Islands have consistently been cold spots across the board and have
emerged as areas with low risk for missing girls.Conclusion: This study
helps us in understanding the magnitude of missing cases across India
and it also identifies which are potentially safe areas as well as worst
areas with regard to missing children. The endemicity also helps us in
identifying the changing trends in each of these areas of interest. This
will serve as a great resource for policy makers and law enforcement
alike.},

Although Croatia has implemented OD policies to support the provision of open data, many geospatial data are still not available, or if available, their level of openness ranks Croatia lower than Slovenia and Serbia on some ranking lists. Benchmarking tools have proven to be a powerful tool in identifying barriers in OD. This paper, therefore, benchmarks the level of openness and provision of geospatial HVD in Croatia, Slovenia and Serbia, using the extended and modified Global Open Data Index methodology (GODI Plus). It is expected that this will provide an answer to the status of OD policies and government engagement in OD in Croatia and identify good OD practices among the three countries analyzed. Furthermore, the results will be a baseline benchmark for future HVD analyses. The results reveal low data openness for Croatia and Serbia, high data openness for Slovenia, and a low level of government engagement in all three proposed countries. © 2023 by the authors.},

    abstract = {As the Supervisory Institution in Statistics, Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) launched an integrated information system (IS) to exercise the Open Government Data (OGD) initiative and to impose the One Data Policy Act. Albeit challenges arise, BPS manages to provide more than 120 thousand publicly accessible datasets. With the success of OGD, many scholars have opted to examine a similar issue from the perspective of users/citizens. However, employees’ perspective remains substantial as employees are the OGD provider. This research administers employees’ views to pinpoint influencing factors in the success of OGD adoption through an IS. The authors seek to comprehend the factors from IS and acceptance manner, thus integrating the Information System Success Model (ISSM) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as the measurement model. This study also administers a cross-sectional questionnaire with close-ended questions to obtain data from 253 IS users in BPS. Using structural equation modelling (SEM), the authors find that all ISSM constructs influence the success of IS while only one construct from UTAUT plays a pivotal role in defining the success. Information Quality, System Quality, Service Quality, User Satisfaction, and System Use remain paramount to the successful implementation, while Performance Expectancy becomes the sole influencing UTAUT factor affecting success. This study therefore offers substantial benefits by aiding other researchers in OGD-related areas and providing in-depth evidence for practitioners in implementing IS for OGD initiatives. © 2023,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

Pathfinder network analysis was performed by extracting keywords assigned to 1,200 data cases, open to the Korean Public Data Portals. Subject clusters were derived for each type of government and their utility was compared using download statistics. Eleven clusters were formed for public institutions with specialized information on national issues such as Health care and Real estate, while 15 clusters were formed for the central government with national administrative information, including Crime and Safety policing. Local governments and offices of education were assigned 16 and 11 topic clusters respectively, with data focusing on regional life such as Local factories and manufacturing, Resident registration, and Lifelong education. Usability was higher in public and central governments that deal with national-level specialized information than for regional-level information. It was also confirmed that subject clusters such as Health care, Real estate, and Crime showed high usability. Furthermore, there was a large gap in data utilization because of the existence of popular data that showed extremely high usage. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

This study aims to address this research gap by investigating the factors that influence the adoption of OGD among government agencies, especially in the Indonesian context. Drawing on previous research on innovation adoption, the study develops a comprehensive research model that integrates the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework and four key factors: perceived benefits, perceived risks, organizational readiness, and external pressures. To empirically examine the research model, survey data from 320 government officials were collected and analyzed through regression and path analysis. The results reveal a significant positive relationship between perceived benefits and external pressures toward the adoption of OGD by government agencies. The findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and agencies seeking to enhance OGD implementation, emphasizing the pivotal role of tangible benefits and external stimuli in driving the adoption of initiatives. © HSE, 2024.},

This benefits data scientists, researchers, business owners, and other potential users seeking datasets for empirical research and business innovation. However, just because Open Government Data (OGD) portals are accessible does not mean that they necessarily adhere to the established rules and principles of data openness. To evaluate the level of openness of 24 OGD portals in Indonesia, this study used the K-means Clustering algorithm to partition them into three levels: Leaders, Followers, and Beginners. A group of 30 participants, including researchers, data scientists, business enablers, and graduate students, rated the portals on 32 sub-questions related to the eight main principles of data disclosure, focusing on health, population, and education datasets. The study found that eight portals were categorized as Leaders, ten as Followers, and seven as Beginners regarding their level of openness. The study demonstrated that the K-means Clustering algorithm can be effectively used to assess the degree of openness of OGD portals in Indonesia based on eight main principles of data openness. The study recommends increasing the number of OGD portals in eastern territories to supplement the existing case studies in the western and central regions. © 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

This paper examines the direct impact of the results of OGD on the satisfaction of citizens and the activities of state institutions. The main purpose of this paper is to study whether there is a link between the availability of OGD and institutional trust, and, if so, to establish whether this effect can guarantee the satisfaction of citizens. The study involved a large-scale survey conducted among residents of the Turkestan region. The survey encompassed questions related to trust in various government entities, the usage of OGD, satisfaction with government services, and socio-demographic factors. Data collected from 360 respondents were subjected to rigorous statistical analysis. A substantial positive correlation between OGD availability and usage and citizens’ trust in government institutions, particularly among frequent internet users, was found. Additionally, the study revealed that OGD positively influences citizens’ satisfaction, which, in turn, contributes to increased trust in government. OGD initiatives play a vital role in enhancing trust in government institutions, particularly in digitally connected populations. Recognizing the mediating role of satisfaction presents opportunities for policymakers to refine strategies aimed at delivering higher-quality public services and strengthening democratic processes. © 2023 Mykolas Riomeris University.

    abstract = {With the eIDAS 2.0 legislation, the European Union seeks to establish a digital identity data ecosystem and to empower citizens to manage digital credentials from various sources through an ID wallet interface. To achieve this, governments must develop holistic orchestration models integrating technical, regulatory, and economic perspectives. This approach will foster ecosystem value creation, address orchestration tensions, and design sustainable operating models for various ecosystem actors. While IS research has explored private-sector governance mechanisms in platform and data ecosystems, a research gap exists in understanding public–private orchestration where governments act as orchestrators. We address this through a structured document analysis of 80 position papers from various stakeholders participating in a public government consultation process and 14 semi-structured in-depth interviews. By examining ecosystem value creation mechanisms, orchestration tensions, and monetization challenges, we identify two government orchestration standard types for the ID wallet provision. The Government ID-Infrastructure Wallet model embodies an ecosystem-integrated public infrastructure, while the Trust ID Wallet Federation exemplifies a dynamic and competition-driven approach. By bridging the self-sovereign identity ecosystem paradigm with digital identity infrastructure research, our work contributes to the understanding and theoretical development of data ecosystems and digital identity research from a government perspective. © The Author(s) 2024.},

In the European Union context, the development of such new business is accompanied by a regulatory and political framework. An important aspect of this regulatory framework regards the legal conditions that enable the data collection, availability, sharing, use and reuse. Within the larger context, this article analyses the development of the European Union regulatory framework governing the availability, sharing and reuse of public sector data, also referred to as Public Sector Information policy. Anchored in the analytical tools provided by Discursive Institutionalism and Critical Data Studies and after studying the evolution of this policy over 25 years, this article argues that economic considerations have been overwhelmingly decisive in the European Union Public Sector Information policy and much less attention has been paid to fundamental rights and democracy issues. It also shows how European Union Public Sector Information policy contributes to the data infrastructure, enabling a thriving data-driven economy. In doing so, this article argues that the possible problematic effects of this new data-driven economy are not only affordances of the technology itself but are also the result of political and regulatory choices. More globally, the article stresses the need for policymakers to inscribe each of the policies and regulations affecting the digital transformation in the framework of fundamental rights and democracy. © The Author(s) 2022.},

    abstract = {Open government data (OGD) holds great potential for firms and the digital economy as a whole and has attracted increasing interest in research and practice in recent years. Governments and organizations worldwide are struggling in exploiting the full potential of OGD and require a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon. Although scientific debates in OGD research are intense and heterogeneous, the field lacks theoretical integration of OGD topics and their systematic consideration in the context of the digital economy. In addition, OGD has been widely neglected by information systems (IS) research, which promises great potential for advancing our knowledge of the OGD concept and its role in the digital economy. To fill in this gap, this study conducts a systematic literature review of 169 empirical OGD studies. In doing so, we develop a theoretical review framework of Antecedents, Decisions, Outcomes (ADO) to unify and grasp the accumulating isolated evidence on OGD in context of the digital economy and provide a theory-informed research agenda to tap the potential of IS research for OGD. Our findings reveal six related key topic clusters of OGD research and substantial gaps, opening up prospective research avenues and particularly outlining how IS research can inform and advance OGD research. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Peer-reviewed articles were identified and analysed from major bibliographic databases, including Web of Science, Digital ACM Library, IEEE Explore Digital Library, and Science Direct. Included articles focus on identifying individual information privacy concerns from the viewpoint of OGD stakeholders or providing solutions for mitigating concerns and risks. Papers that discussed and focused on general privacy issues or privacy concerns of open data in general or open science privacy concerns were excluded. Three streams of research were identified: 1) exploring privacy concerns and balance with OGD value propositions, 2) proposing solutions for mitigating privacy concerns, and 3) developing risk-based frameworks for the OGD program at different governmental levels. Findings suggest that contradictions with Fair Information Practices, reidentification risks, conflicts with OGD value propositions, and smart city data practices are significant privacy concerns in the literature. Proposed solutions include technical, legal, and procedural measures to mitigate privacy concerns. Building on the findings, practical implications and suggested future research directions are provided. © 2023, Department for E-Governance and Administration. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {The use of individual visualizations for Open Government Data (OGD) has been shown not to be entirely efficient in engaging citizens. Dashboards constitute a promising solution, but how they should be designed and applied in an OGD context remains under-investigated. This article examines whether the use of well-designed dashboards can increase citizen engagement with OGD. To achieve this objective, a literature review on dashboard design principles is conducted. Then, the outputs of this literature review are used to compile a list of 16 dashboard design principles in the context of OGD. Next, we apply these design principles to build the Namur (Belgium) Budget Dashboard (NBDash) in order to provide a practical application of our research and use it for evaluation. Finally, we use NBDash as a use case to evaluate the usefulness of well-designed dashboards compared to individual visualizations through an experimental study. The results of the experimental design study with 108 participants suggest that the implementation of well-designed dashboards can be beneficial in encouraging the use of data on portals. In addition, the selection of meaningful metrics and the use of appropriate visualizations, all organized in a clear presentation, have proven to be the primary factors of successful dashboards. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.},

    abstract = {Machine learning (ML) prediction determinants based on open data (OD) are investigated in this work, which is accomplished by examining current research trends over ten years. Currently, OD is commonly regarded as the most crucial trend for users to improve their ability to make decisions, particularly to the exponential expansion of social networking sites (SNSs) and open government data (OGD). The purpose of this study was to examine if there was an increase in the usage of OD in ML prediction techniques by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) of the results of the trends. The papers published in major online scientific databases between 2011 and 2020, including ScienceDirect, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM, and Springer, were identified and analysed. After various selection processes, according to SLR based on precise inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 302 articles were located. However, only 81 of them were included. The findings were presented and plotted based on the research questions (RQs). In conclusion, this research could be beneficial to organisations, practitioners, and researchers by providing information on current trends in the implementation of ML prediction using OD setting by mapping studies based on the RQs designed, the most recent growth, and the necessity for future research based on the findings. © 2022.

    abstract = {Data Warehouse (DW) and on line analytical processing (OLAP) as parts of business intelligence (BI) are proven platform for decision-making support. Over the previous decade, the advent of Web 2.0 technologies has increased the accessibility of the data web across the internet. The use of semantic web (SW) including linked open data, linked open statistical data, and open government data is rising at a breakneck pace, creating a greater pool of machine-readable data that can be shared and analyzed for strategic decision-making. The new DW concept takes a novel approach to merging the availability of these data resources containing the spatiotemporal data. This paper proposed a way to publish agricultural production data in SW using a spatiotemporal DW vocabulary called QB4MobOLAP. The data sources come from the village and rural area information system (SIDeKa), which records agricultural production transactions with spatiotemporal information. This paper also applying a new spatiotemporal data warehousing technique for analyzing spatiotemporal data for agricultural productivity. The experiment uses 2.916.864 triples with temporal type data in a fact table, and 81.914 triples dimension data with spatial and temporal data. This approach offers a practical, simple model, and good performance for enabling executive decisions on agriculture production analysis. The experiment has execution time average below 10 s for spatiotemporal aggregation and less development time compared with DBMS. This approach also has 5-stars open data index. This paper also highlighted opportunities for scaling and fostering the spatiotemporal data warehousing initiative © 2023, International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems.All Rights Reserved.},

This sharing of data, which has no restrictions or costs, has been called open government data. The increased use of this kind of data poses several challenges, such as the quality of the provided data. It becomes necessary to evaluate factors like the reliability, integrity, and accuracy of data and apply guidelines and metrics to ensure its quality for the intended use. This way, it is no longer sufficient to make data available, as having guidelines to evaluate its quality for other public agencies and citizens becomes a necessity.

First, a tentative framework was synthesized from previous research, empirical material, and public documents. Second, it was reviewed by informed OGD experts, as well as researchers attending a work conference, and evaluated in two international contexts. As a result, the publisher framework includes environments, social units, and fields of work.

These dashboards are webpages that present data in different format, such as text, maps, graphs and tables, and can reduce information asymmetry between the government and people. This paper relies on a combination of varied literature to build a Dashboard Transparency Evaluation Framework: Open Government Data, websites transparency assessment, dashboard functionalities and information flowchart, and collaborative stakeholder participation in open government processes. Based on an exploratory approach this paper adopted the structured search and evaluation method to investigate and evaluate the dashboards portals. This paper concludes that data are shown in different formats in all countries and with different functionalities and thus can help people follow the evolution of the disease and also the policy decision. However there is room to improve transparency, such as the integration of dashboards with open data policies and access to information or the interoperability with legacy systems.

Specifically, we examined the key attributes of the dashboard data notes, such as data source, update frequency, and data suppression disclaimers. We also studied the terms and phrases used, as well as topic themes of the data policy texts. Using a data policy analysis model, our results revealed a series of gaps and inconsistencies in the policy statements. Connecting these gaps and inconsistencies with potential problems that could violate individual Open Data Principles (ODP) and the FAIR principles, we made recommendations to help resolve these missing areas and fix the inconsistencies, so that open government data can be managed and used to further the very core of open data practice. Further research that we plan to carry out includes confirmation and validation of our analysis model and our approach of linking the examination and assessment of open data policy with ODP and the FAIR principles. © 2023},

In several countries, it is difficult to access government data as the information are dispersed, disconnected, and poorly structured. For this reason, this work presents a framework to gather, unify, and enrich missing person data from distributed web sources. The framework allows inserting new tasks specific to the user’s domain to improve data quality. In this study, Brazilian missing person data from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and governmental websites were collected and semantically enriched. To enhance the understanding of the gathered missing people cases, we create interpretive models using machine learning techniques to extract knowledge and to encourage the use of standards for publishing the data that are frequently ignored by organizations, hindering analysis and decision-making on data. After the collection and semantic enrichment process, there was an increase of approximately 11% in the data present in the base. Also, the mining process evidenced the disappearance and reappearance of a person in Brazil according to several factors such as age, state initiatives, skin tone, hair colors, etc. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Open Payments is a dataset published annually by the US Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services that documents the transfers of value from pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers to physicians, prescribing non-physicians, and teaching hospitals. In the article, I show context became a manifold concern as differentially-situated actors engaged in modes of public advocacy and social action around not only what data meant, but also what it meant to make data meaningful. I show how “context” took on multiple meanings as it was brought into relationship with certain concepts (such as “light,” “transparency,” and “interpretation”) and as stakeholders developed arguments for where they believed meaning should originate. In presenting this case, I call for further ethnographic attention to the ways in which meaning-making is enacted in relation to datasets—particularly those datasets intended to hold institutions accountable. I conclude the article meditating on the political significance of attending to various “context cultures” when putting data signification in context, along with the implications for how critical data studies scholars historicize big data epistemologies and rhetoric. © The Author(s) 2024.},

    abstract = {Objective: It is reported that age and sex have been identified as potential risk factors for severe outcomes and the distribution of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), although the specifics of these relationships are unclear. Furthermore, little is known about the relationship between age, sex, COVID-19, and population density in Thailand. This study proposed to examine the relationships among age, sex, population density, and the number of COVID-19 patients in Thailand. Material and Methods: In this nationwide descriptive correlational study, the dataset of daily COVID-19 cases in Thailand between January 12, 2020, and November 30, 2020, and population density (people/km2) in each province of Thailand was retrieved from the Open Government Data of Thailand, the Registration Office Department of the Interior, the Ministry of the Interior, and the National Statistical Office of Thailand. Chi-square and Pearson product-moment correlation were used to determine the difference and relationships among studied variables. Simple linear regression was used to predict the number of COVID-19 cases based on population density. Results: The findings illustrated a significant difference between male and female patients, in which the number of male patients was higher than female patients across age groups 31-45 years, 40-60 years, and >60 years (p-value<0.010). Further, population density was significantly associated with the number of COVID-19 cases. Conclusion: This investigation would provide intervention planning implications during potential future pandemics, especially in groups at higher risk (males, age 17-46 years old, and people living in high-density population areas). © 2021 JHSMR.

    abstract = {Data analysis often uses data sets that were collected for different purposes. Indeed, new insights are often obtained by combining data sets that were produced independently of each other, for example by combining data from outside an organization with internal data resources. As a result, there is a need to discover, clean, integrate and restructure data into a form that is suitable for an intended analysis. Data preparation, also known as data wrangling, is the process by which data are transformed from its existing representation into a form that is suitable for analysis. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art in data preparation, by: (i) describing functionalities that are central to data preparation pipelines, specifically profiling, matching, mapping, format transformation and data repair; and (ii) presenting how these capabilities surface in different approaches to data preparation, that involve programming, writing workflows, interacting with individual data sets as tables, and automating aspects of the process. These functionalities and approaches are illustrated with reference to a running example that combines open government data with web extracted real estate data. © 2023, The Author(s).},

    abstract = {This study investigates motorcycle-related fatalities among children under 15 in Thailand by analyzing three detailed and accurate datasets from the Open Government Data Center. Using exploratory data analysis, including descriptive statistics and two-step cluster analysis, the research seeks to identify trends, patterns, and distinct profiles of motorcycle accident mortality. The analysis reveals a noticeable increase in fatalities from motorcycle accidents during the academic year's second semester (November to February), particularly in the hours of 3-8 p.m., just after school ends. Risk behaviors factors identified include not wearing helmets and alcohol consumption, highlighting the necessity for an immediate reevaluation of the circumstances leading to these accidents and the implementation of specific preventive measures during these high-risk times. Moreover, cluster analysis, considering the timing of accidents, motorcycle usage, gender, and age, reveals five distinct mortality profiles. Significantly, the group most affected comprises boys aged 10-14 years, indicating an urgent need for targeted interventions. This detailed analysis provides critical insights into the demographics most at risk and forms the basis for creating customized safety measures. Furthermore, this research clarifies the temporal patterns of fatalities and emphasizes the essential role of parents, guardians, and educational institutions in closely monitoring children's access to motorcycles during these vulnerable periods. By offering a nuanced understanding of the factors leading to the increased risk of motorcycle accidents among minors, including the effects of gender, age, and timing of incidents in different regions of Thailand, the study contributes valuable perspectives for shaping evidence-based interventions and policies. These insights are crucial for devising strategies aimed at mitigating these preventable tragedies. © Geoinformatics International.},

OGD also assist citizens in obtaining other forms of information to aid in decision-making or planning. However, poor data quality (DQ) leads to users losing interest and trust in using the data. DQ is a type of measurement that determines the usefulness of data. It is a vast issue for discussion, with uncertainty arising from the diversity across a range of descriptions and dimensions. Hence, this study explored the concept of DQ and found the completeness dimension as a vital component in OGD. According to an analysis of 37 articles, incomplete, missing, and unknown values all had a direct effect on completeness. This study illustrated recent ways of addressing the issue, as well as real life examples. Finally, this study offers recommendations for novices and other intellectuals for improvement in future research.  © 2013 IEEE.},

The potential benefits of open government data are numerous and include increasing transparency and accountability, enhancing citizens' quality of life, and boosting innovation. However, realizing these benefits is not always straightforward, as the usage of this raw data often faces challenges related to its format, structure, and heterogeneity which hinder its processability and integration. In response to these challenges, we propose an approach to maximize the usage of open government data and achieve its potential benefits. This approach leverages knowledge graphs to extract value from open government data and drive the construction of a knowledge graph from structured, semi-structured, and non-structured formats. It involves the extraction, transformation, semantic enrichment, and integration of heterogeneous open government data sources into an integrated and semantically enhanced knowledge graph. Learning mechanisms and ontologies are used to efficiently construct the knowledge graph. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach using real-world public procurement data and show that it can detect potential fraud such as favoritism © 2023, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.All Rights Reserved.},

Accordingly, all governmental and non-governmental organizations may publish data that they own open for various purposes on the Internet without any restrictions such as (climate statistics, education statistics, transportation, industry, water abstraction, etc.). Further, Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives are proliferated in every country including Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). OGD should supposedly escalate the transparency, collaboration, and participation of citizens towards using OGD. However, the presentation of OGD format may not be attractive enough to users and vice-versa the data may not be easy for them to understand and interpret. These stumbling blocks may dampen the use of OGD among citizens. The problems can be resolved through visualization of the available data sets and to represent these data in accordance to user preference. This research emphasizes on visualization efforts of OGD in KSA named JeddahDashboard (JDB) website. The aim of creating JeddahDashBoard is to visualize the published government data in KSA. The idea was inspired by the DublinDashBoard in Ireland where data and real-time information, time series index data, and interactive maps on vast aspects of the city are provided mostly in an interactive ways and attractive charts that are easy to understand. In order to create JeddahDashBoard, two tools were used "the tableau" and then "chart. js" because the later was simple and flexible.

However, extant research highlights a need for improved feedback loops, collaboration, and a more demand-driven publication of OGD. In this study, we explore how public platform providers can address this issue by enabling collaboration within OGD ecosystems, both in terms of the OGD, and any related Open Source Software (OSS) and standards. We conducted an exploratory multiple-case study of four OGD ecosystems with diverse characteristics, using a qualitative research approach. Based on the cases, we present a conceptual model that highlights different attributes of OGD ecosystems that may help public entities in designing and orchestrating new or existing OGD ecosystems. We conclude that enabling collaboration in an OGD ecosystem is a complex exercise yet believe that it offers ways for public entities in how they can leverage open innovation to address their goals and directives. © 2021, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

In this paper we propose the Open Government and Participation Index (ogpi), based on previous academic works, to compare open government strategies over time and among different countries. The index, which weighs different open government dimensions, is built for a sample of 33 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (oecd) from open and consistent sources. The results show that the areas of transparency and open data have a wide room for improvement and that participation and collaboration strategies require an autonomous approach.

A literature review was carried out, in which the objective of the research was defined, a query was made in different sources, the data was prepared and the literature was classified according to the defined selection criteria and thus align the selected components in a strategic scheme that prioritizes the exploitation of data as a source of trends and innovations. Three essential principles were identified: Fitness for Use, Process Orientation and Continuous Improvement, from which three dimensions emerge to consider the context, properties and value representation of the data, with 6 guidelines and 12 attributes that gradually contribute with the level of quality required according to the technical reference documents for the Colombian context. In conclusion, the proposed model makes it possible to develop a quality assessment of open government data to enable, through its publication and reuse, the benefits of converting the raw material of the data into products that are materialized in relevant information and coherent for the public and private sectors and the general public. © 2020 Universidad de Santander.

    abstract = {All datasets emerge from and are enmeshed in power-laden semiotic systems. While emerging data ethics curriculum is supporting data science students in identifying data biases and their consequences, critical attention to the cultural histories and vested interests animating data semantics is needed to elucidate the assumptions and political commitments on which data rest, along with the externalities they produce. In this article, I introduce three modes of reading that can be engaged when studying datasets—a denotative reading (extrapolating the literal meaning of values in a dataset), a connotative reading (tracing the socio-political provenance of data semantics), and a deconstructive reading (seeking what gets Othered through data semantics and structure). I then outline how I have taught students to engage these methods when analyzing three datasets in Data and Society—a course designed to cultivate student competency in politically aware data analysis and interpretation. I show how combined, the reading strategies prompt students to grapple with the double binds of perceiving contemporary problems through systems of representation that are always situated, incomplete, and inflected with diverse politics. While I introduce these methods in the context of teaching, I argue that the methods are integral to any data practice in the conclusion. © The Author(s) 2021.},

    abstract = {Citizen engagement with open government data (OGD) can enhance the effectiveness of governments and improve not only the quality of public policy making but also public services provisioning and ability to address societal problems. Although previous research gives insight into citizen’s drivers and inhibitors for engaging with OGD, they have not yet been integrated into a single conceptual model. The aims of this study are twofold: 1) to systematically review the literature on individual citizens’ drivers and inhibitors for engaging with OGD and 2) to develop a conceptual model of citizen engagement with OGD based on the findings of the literature review. To attain this objective, the authors systematically analyzed 52 papers published in the period 2009-2019. Seven categories of drivers of citizen engagement are identified: citizen’s profile, personal, performance-related, economic, social, technical, and political. Three groups of inhibitors are also identified: citizen’s profile, technical, and political. This study helps in understanding how the engagement of citizens can be enhanced.

    abstract = {A study on the feasibility of a national open data policy in Zimbabwe was done to document open government data globally and in Zimbabwe. The study showcases the benefits of open government data and the opportunities and challenges toward the development of a national open data policy. Web content analysis and document analysis were used to collect data concerning the readiness of the country in implementing open data activities. The open data barometer was used to gather qualitative data which is essential in assessing the preparedness of the country in opening up government and research data. Content analysis was used to analyse the data which was presented thematically based on the objectives of the study. The findings indicated that the Government of Zimbabwe has endorsed a couple of open data frameworks though some projects are done by non-governmental organizations. The major challenge is implementation of these conventions and commitment to make the data accessible. The results indicated that open data must be made available and accessible within Zimbabwe as a matter of national policy. The author recommends the need for advocacy and continuous awareness creation among the stakeholders so that a national open data policy can be crafted and enacted. The enactment of a national open data policy would guide the use of and access to government data and research data which is valuable in research. Copyright © 2022 Chigwada.},

The aim of the study was the proposal of the SDI openness assessment approach based on existing openness assessment frameworks, as well as the presentation of the Polish Spatial Data Infrastructure (PSDI) development towards openness. The results indicated that ten geodetic and cartographic databases fulfilled ten out of eleven criteria of data openness, according to the methodological assumptions, and reached a 3-star level of openness. The need for further development of the infrastructure towards sharing public administration data is recognized, as well as non-governmental data that meet the open data criteria, thus contributing to the openness of the SDI. The proposed assessment method, referenced to a five-level data openness system and providing clear scoring benchmarking for assessing SDI openness, may be used for comparative analysis of SDI openness in different countries, including EU Member States that draw on the experience of the implementation of the INSPIRE Directive. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

This paper aims to address the data quality issues through a framework composed of several components aimed at measuring and monitoring the OGD portals in an automated way. Through this proposed framework, is intended to monitor and evaluate OGD quality, respectively OGD portals, and to show their progress/regress based on accumulated scores for different periods. The advantage of the proposed framework is the compatibility with any OGD Portal due to its flexibility of integration. The integration interface consists of only a few basic metrics but is necessary that almost the OGD portal possesses and can produce very compressive results. The other advantage is the possibility of extraction of collected data for further analysis and the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) for prediction purposes to point out how the OGD portals will stand in the next period. © 2021.

    abstract = {Open data initiatives are a crucial aspect of effective e-governance strategy. They embody aspirations towards sociopolitical values of transparency, trust, confidence, and accountability, pertaining to the relationship between a government and its citizens. The importance of such initiatives is especially important for an emerging economy such as Saudi Arabia which is undergoing rapid social changes directed by a contemporary national vision. The effectiveness of open data initiatives depends strongly on (a) the quality of the data available, (b) the soundness of the methodologies and suitability of platforms used to prepare and present the data, and (c) the ability of the data to facilitate the kinds of insights and social-action that are sought from that data to ensure successful e-governance. This paper investigates the feasibility of current Saudi government open data initiatives in this regard. It assesses existing approaches to improve the effectiveness of open government data through transforming it into linked-open data (using the Resource Description Framework [RDF]) by connecting disparate sources of structured data therein. It proposes to improve existing approaches by suggesting a framework for automating the linking sub-process of existing approaches and organizing the data to be queried through SPARQL. Moreover, it evaluates the potential benefit of this proposal by discussing the kinds of policy insights this could generate which would be difficult without it. © 2019 MECS.},

    abstract = {Open data initiative has been adopted by many countries worldwide due to the need for establishing agile open government and knowledge-based economy. As a result, we can witness an increasing amount of government open data shared on public government's portals that become sources of rich big data. While this scenario provides data transparency and eases accessibility for public data consumers, the quality aspect, or the veracity property (as commonly coined to big data) of open data is the topic of concerned. Not only poor quality data causes misleading results, the reputation of the government as an open data provider can also be negatively affected. Thus, to understand how the government's portals deal with the veracity aspect of their data, in this paper, we present the results of examining quality criteria imposed by selected government's data portals for their data contributors. In particular, we extract quality criteria from the open data policy of the government's data portals under study. The result shows that out of 108 portals, only 27% of the portals explicitly state their quality criteria in the policy, with varying coverage of quality criteria. The frequency of the identified 15 quality criteria shows the types of quality criteria that receive more (and less) attention by the open data portals based on their relative importance. We conclude with suggestions on the areas of further research and development in the government's open data. © 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication.

Therefore, quality control for releasing COVID-19 data is very important, accounting for the releasing agent, the content to release, and the impact of the released data. We suggest that the quality requirements for the release of COVID-19 data be based on the global perspective that the goal of open epidemic data is to create a valuable ecological chain in which all stakeholders are involved. As such, the collection, aggregation, and release process of the COVID-19 data should meet not only the data quality standards of official statistics and health statistics, but also the characteristics of the epidemic statistics and the needs of pandemic prevention. The quality requirements should follow the unique characteristics of the epidemic and be scrutinized by the public. We integrate the perspectives of official statistics, health statistics, and open government data, proposing five quality dimensions for releasing COVID-19 data: accuracy, timeliness, systematicness, user-friendliness and security. Through case studies on the official websites of Chinese provincial health commission, we report the quality problems in the current data releasing process and suggest improvements. © 2020 Center for Applied Statistics, School of Statistics, Renmin University of China.

Materials and Methods: The data set on monthly COVID-19 in Thailand between January and July 2020 were retrieved from the Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. Data regarding people's travel in Thailand during the COVID-19 pandemic and for the same period of 2019 were retrieved from Open Government Data of Thailand. A paired t-test was used to compare the differences between the number of journeys made in each mode of transport in 2019 (January - July) and 2020 (January - July). Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient was used to examine the relationships among studied variables. Results: A Paired Samples t-test showed that from January until July 2020, the number of journeys made by public buses, ships, and airplanes declined by more than 50% from the previous year (p < 0.05). Pearson correlation coefficients showed that the mean monthly number of COVID-19 cases was significantly and inversely correlated with the number of public bus journeys made (r = -0.897, p < 0.01), the number of train journeys (r = -0.834, p < 0.05), ship journeys (r = -0.890, p < 0.01), and airplane journeys (r = -0.911, p < 0.01). There was no significant relationship between the number of COVID-19 cases and private car journeys (r = -0.405, p = 0.367). Conclusion: During the pandemic, the number of journeys has been decreased. Moreover, the correlation between the number of journeys and COVID-19 cases has been shown in our analysis. © 2021.

    abstract = {Data providers share open government data (OGD) to be transformed by intermediaries into products and services (solutions). OGD is believed to lead to many benefits. However, OGD is not reaching its expected level of reuse, which can come from a lack of awareness, interest to fulfil the user’s needs, or novel perspectives to understand them. This paper presents a set of design principles to develop tailored mixed methods that capture activity-based information needs of users which could be satisfied by building information products based on OGD. The produced insights can help data providers and intermediaries to realign ideas of solutions to the user’s information needs. The set of nine design principles are developed using design science research and are based on previous research and empirical testing. They have been implemented with two groups of users and three groups of data providers as participants of, respectively, face-to-face and digital workshops. The design principles and the produced insights were evaluated with practitioners. Implications for practice are that starting with the users’ information needs can open a broader range of solutions and potential paths of OGD reuses, while following the design principles can help the practitioners cope with the fuzziness of the information needs and ideation process. For research, we propose a novel method that goes beyond the exclusive data provider-intermediary interaction to study new paths to improve the realization of OGD benefits. © 2021 The Author(s).},

    abstract = {Business Intelligence (BI) technology with Extract, Transform, and Loading process, Data Warehouse, and OLAP have demonstrated the ability of information and knowledge generation for supporting decision making. In the last decade, the advancement of the Web 2.0 technology is improving the accessibility of web of data across the cloud. Linked Open Data, Linked Open Statistical Data, and Open Government Data is increasing massively, creating a more significant computer-recognizable data available for sharing. In agricultural production analytics, data resources with high availability and accessibility is a primary requirement. However, today’s data accessibility for production analytics is limited in the 2 or 3-stars open data format and rarely has attributes for spatiotemporal analytics. The new data warehouse concept has a new approach to combine the openness of data resources with mobility or spatiotemporal data in nature. This new approach could help the decision-makers to use external data to make a crucial decision more intuitive and flexible. This paper proposed the development of a spatiotemporal data warehouse with an integration process using service-oriented architecture and open data sources. The data sources are originating from the Village and Rural Area Information System (SIDeKa) that capture the agricultural production transaction in a daily manner. This paper also describes the way to spatiotemporal analytics for agricultural production using a new spatiotemporal data warehouse approach. The experiment results, by executing six relevant spatiotemporal query samples on DW with fact table contains 324096 tuples with temporal integer/float for each tuple, 4495 tuples of field dimension with geographic data as polygons, 80 tuples of village dimension, dozens of tuples of the district, subdistrict, province dimensions. The DW time dimension contains 3653 tuples representing a date for ten years, proved that this new approach has a convenient, simple model, and expressive performance for supporting executive to make decisions on agriculture production analytics based on spatiotemporal data. This research also underlines the prospects for scaling and nurturing the spatiotemporal data warehouse initiative. © 2020},

Originality/value: Researchers are investigating public value generation through digitally transformed public services, i.e., public value directly generated by the government. However, the literature needs a better understanding of this phenomenon through digital technologies, based on open public data, developed by non-governmental actors, such as the Operação Serenata de Amor website. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a qualitative approach to understand and describe the public value generated by Operação Serenata de Amor. The data were collected through citizen comments about the website’s initiatives on social media and in articles published on the internet. The data were analyzed through content analysis. Findings: The Operação Serenata de Amor generated public value by doing, facilitating, and stimulating social control. It was also identified that the site added value to society by increasing citizens’ ability to exercise social control. However, this work was limited to analyzing data collected on the internet. In future studies, researchers may collect data through interviews with citizens to understand, with more details, the public value generated by the website. © 2021 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

Open government data has beneficial effects on economic growth by stimulating the industry to produce goods and services, which in turn accelerates production, job provision, and government tax earnings. However, in developing countries, the use of open government data is currently at its nascent stage and facing the problem of less participation besides the lack of continuance intention of utilization. To fill in the identified gap, the current study integrated Expectation Confirmation Model and IS success model to propose a model, which may help in predicting users’ continuance intention to utilize open government data.

    abstract = {Introduction: Opening government databases can positively contribute to democracy, transparency and social control, as it provides opportunities for citizens to access, reuse, modify and redistribute non-confidential information from public bodies. However, not all data of interest to society are currently published in open formats. This study verifies whether the data referring to the Federal Institutes of Education, Science and Technology, which are commonly requested from the Office of the Comptroller General by civil society, are being cataloged in the Brazilian Open Data Portal. Method: Quantitative research was conducted on the Brazilian Open Data Portal with the support of the documentary research technique, which allowed us to analyze the datasets published by the Federal Institutes. An index was created to analyze each of the 14 collected themes, which originated a quantitative indicator used to compare the results of each Federal Institute involved in the research. Results: It was identified that 73.70% of the Federal Institutes cataloged at least one dataset on the Brazilian Open Data Portal. However, there were strikingly several gaps in the availability of open data by these institutions, in addition to the low adherence to opening data in accordance with the recommendations of the Office of the Comptroller General. Conclusions: Studies such as the one carried out in this paper contribute to the Public Administration, especially considering the context of Federal Institutes, to have subsidies that indicate points for improvement with regard to society’s demands on transparency and governance. © 2022 Marques, Bax, Lopes Júnior, Souza & Melo.},

The demand for new services also promotes renewed entrepreneurship centred on responding to new social and territorial needs through new technologies. In this sense we speak of Open Data as an enabling infrastructure for the development of innovation and as an instrument to the development and diffusion of Innovation and Communications Technology (ICT) in the public system as well as creating space for innovation for businesses, particularly SMEs, based on the exploitation of information assets of the territory. The Open Data Trentino Project has initiated and fosters the process of opening of public information and develops as a natural consequence of this process of openness, the creation of innovative services for and with the citizens.

Four types of support were identified: 1) ‘Figure it out yourself’, 2) ‘Leading users by the hand’, 3) ‘Training to provide the basics’ and 4) ‘Learning from peers’. The author provides recommendations to improve the support of researchers’ open data analysis and to subsequently obtain new insights for policy making to solve societal challenges.},

Over 100 countries worldwide have introduced access to information legislation: 50+ in Europe; a dozen in Africa; 20 in the Americas and Caribbean; more than 15 in Asia and the Pacific; and two in the Middle East (Banisar,2014). This article will provide an overview of access to information legislation and focus on the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 as a case example. It will discuss the impact of the UK FOI Act on public authorities, with particular attention to records management implications, drawing on research undertaken by University College London. In the final section, it will reflect on relationships between access to information and open government data. If governments are moving to more openness, what implications might this have for those charged with implementing FOI and RTI policies, including for records management professionals? © 2015 The Round Table Ltd.},

Open government data and Information Communication Technologies offer promising tools to enhance participation in democratic procedures. To better understand this expected outcome, the Open Data Barometer provides a cross-national study measuring readiness, implementation, and impact of open data. The barometer reveals puzzling inconsistencies. Countries scoring high in readiness and implementation do not consistently demonstrate high scores of impact. Furthermore, impact is elusive in most countries. Investigating what preconditions allow societies to realize impact can help inform policy makers, technologists, and civil society leaders on best practices to implement open data tools and policy. This paper looks specifically at the social impact of open data, described as marginalized groups having greater access and participation in government decision making. This research design that implements most similar systems and fuzzy logic, will evaluate the relationship between civil society and open data’s social impact in eight Latin American count ries. Results indicate that societies rich in political capital experience greater social impact from open data. © 2014, Department for E-Governance and Administration. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {Citizen engagement figures prominently on political agendas around the world. In this context, high hopes are pinned to Open Government, open data and ICT tools. At the same time, there are fears of a widening digital divide, where large groups of society are in danger of being excluded from societal processes, for example due to having difficulties in using the online tools provided. In this paper, we propose an approach that has the potential to address many key issues in this context (e.g. accessibility, complexity, engagement). It relies on space and time as common integrators, and uses augmented interactive geo-visualizations to facilitate citizen engagement. We report on key challenges that need to be overcome to realize this approach and on initial progress towards this goal. We describe a set of prototypical tools aimed at supporting citizen engagement in the envisioned way, and discuss the approach as well as its potentials, issues and challenges in detail. Initial experiences and results indicate that our approach is not only technically feasible but it can also empower citizens to more effectively engage with societal and governmental processes. © 2014, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

The Government dataset available in the portals (Data.gov.in) is only raw format, as the data is provided in raw format (.csv,.json etc.), it is hard to make much sense of it without pre-processing and filter. It requires some level of technical expertise to compile, filter, transform and visualize the data to make sense. In the proposed system implemented the mobile application to importing datasets from public domain sources and then plotting for user-understanding and friendly manner. As most of the goods prices move because of the supply-demand differences, the proposed Japanese candlestick charts used to predict/forecast patterns in short term and long term by capturing the change in trend using moving averages, pattern recognition methods. This forecasting model has been used in japan to forecast wheat/grain prices with high level of accuracy. As most of the Small and Medium Business owners, farmers, Traders are not so tech-savvy it become a hurdle for them to get data and interpret metrics from it.

However, as open data has grown, a critical literature has also emerged which questions who the true beneficiaries of open data are, as well as highlighting the high costs it places on government. Hence systematic research on the actual outcomes of open data projects is urgently needed. This article seeks to explain the factors which promote greater levels of downloads of open government data. We show that the use of profit making datasets far exceeds those which could be used to enhance government transparency or service delivery. We also show that well updated datasets with high quality metadata are more likely to be downloaded. We conclude by supporting currently developing calls for prioritisation in open government data programmes. Copyright © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

With this objective, the authors attempt to identify initial factors that influence OGD implementation in the public sectors and discern how far the OGD initiative in Malaysia has grown since its inception. The authors make the highlight of the OGD implementation phase rather than adoption phase due to the research aim is to look at the OGD activities beyond adoption. Adoption phase is where the organization is in the state of deciding whether to adopt an innovation or not, while the implementation phase is the extent where the innovation is taking into actual use. Taking from the perspective of the central agency who is leading the OGD initiative, by using interview, observation, and desk research as the research approaches, the issues pertaining to OGD implementation is consolidated into the technology-organization-environment framework. The findings have indicated that data granularity, culture, policy, resources, skills, incentives, use and participation, and external pressure are the current issues transpired in the OGD implementation. These findings are contributing to the conceptual framework of authors' future works in determining the factors influencing OGD post-adoption in the public sectors. © 2019 Insight Society.},

    abstract = {National governments often expect municipalities to develop toward open cities and be equally motivated to open up municipal data, yet municipalities have different characteristics influencing their motivations. This paper aims to reveal how municipality size influences municipalities' motivation perspectives on opening up municipality data. To this end, Q-methodology is used, which is a method that is suited to objectify people's frames of mind on a particular topic. By applying this method to 37 municipalities in the Netherlands, we elicited the motivation perspectives of three main groups of municipalities: (1) advocating municipalities, (2) careful municipalities, and (3) conservative municipalities. We found that advocating municipalities are mainly large-sized municipalities (> 65,000 inhabitants) and a few small-sized municipalities (< 35,000 inhabitants). Careful municipalities concern municipalities of all sizes (small, medium, and large). The conservative municipality perspective is more common among smaller-sized municipalities. Our findings do not support the statement "the smaller the municipality, the less motivated it is to open up its data". However, the type and amount of municipality resources do influence motivations to share data or not. We provide recommendations for how open data policy makers on the national level need to support the three groups of municipalities and municipalities of different sizes in different ways to stimulate the provision of municipal data to the public as much as possible. Moreover, if national governments can identify which municipalities adhere to which motivation perspective, they can then develop more targeted open data policies that meet the requirements of the municipalities that adhere to each perspective. This should result in more open data value creation. © 2018 by the authors.},

In most developed countries, the law requires public authorities to provide online information to ensure competitive tendering as far as possible, for which the adequate announcement of tenders is an essential requirement. In addition, transparency laws being proposed in such countries are making the monitoring of public contracts by citizens a fundamental right. This paper describes the PPROC ontology, which has been developed to give support to both processes, publication and accountability, by semantically describing public procurement processes and contracts. The PPROC ontology is extensive, since it covers not only the usual data about the tender, its objectives, deadlines and awardees, but also details of the whole process, from the initial contract publication to its termination. This makes it possible to use the ontology for both open data publication purposes and for the overall management of the public contract procurement process.},

    abstract = {The disclosure of open government data is a complex activity that may create public value yet might also encounter risks, such as the misinterpretation and misuse of data. While politicians support data release and assume that the positive value of open data will dominate, many governmental organizations are reluctant to open their data, as they are afraid of the dark side. The objective of this paper is to provide a decision-making model that assists in trade-offs between the pros and cons of open data. Data disclosure is dependent on the type of data (e.g. its sensitivity, structure and quality) and the context (e.g. organizational policies, legislation and the political influences). Based on the literature and fifteen in-depth interviews with public sector officials and data archivists, this paper identifies contextual and dataset-related variables which influence a trade-off. A decision-making model is presented capturing trade-offs, and in this way providing guidance for weighing the creation of public value and the risks. The model can be used for decision-making to open or not to open data. It is likely that the decision regarding which data should be opened or closed will shift over time. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.},

    abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to examine the use and acceptance of open government data (OGD) of different stakeholder groups in India. Design/methodology/approach: Following an empirical investigation among 244 respondents in India, the paper deploys path analysis via LISREL. The conceptual construction of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework is used to assess the behavioral intention to use and accept OGD. Multiple regression analysis informs the relationship of demographic variables with the behavioral intention to use and accept OGD. Findings: Path analysis showed that there is an increased use and acceptance of OGD among the respondents. Multiple regression analysis shows that men are more likely to use open data sets than women. Individual differences are found among the respondents with regard to OGD usage. Thus, while men may tap open data sets in line with their purposes and professional backgrounds, women are likely to tap the data sets even for non-professional purposes. Furthermore, the respondents who are younger in age are more behaviorally inclined to accepting and using OGD than their older counterparts. Practical implications: The Indian government needs to popularize and familiarize OGD initiatives among the people to a greater extent. The utilitarian value of OGD may be provided when data sets are more user-friendly, frequently updated and accurate. This would facilitate in better provision of public services besides appreciating the public sentiment. Further, with increased interaction between citizens and the government, public accountability and transparency may be better realized. Social implications: The study shows that different groups of people are engaging in tapping information through government websites and related portals. Societal influence was found to be an important factor which predicts the acceptance and usage of OGD. An infrastructure can help to enable the use of OGD. Originality/value: Hitherto, studies have focused on OGD initiatives in the developed countries, but extant literature is scarce on developing countries. Therefore, this study seeks to fill the literature gap by probing OGD use and acceptance among different stakeholder groups in India. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

All levels of the United States government are working hard to promote open data and its portals. However, there is still a lack of studies on local-level OGD portals in the United States, particularly on the quality of metadata adopted by these portals. By examining 200 US cities, a list of 112 local-level portals is sampled and we investigate the current usages of open data platforms for building local-level OGD portals. This study further investigates and discusses the adoption and potential issues of metadata on those OGD portals. Our result findings discuss the platform distributions among US local-level OGD portals, and also highlight several critical issues associated with metadata on the portals. We anticipate the results will inspire further studies on identifying solutions to improve the metadata and enhance the usability of open government data portals.

    abstract = {Open government data (OGD) can enable outbound open innovation (OI) that is beneficial to society. However, innovation barriers hinder OGD users from generating value. While previous studies have detailed a large number of such barriers, little is known of how different types of OGD users are affected, and when the barriers appear in their innovation processes. To this end, this paper describes a case study of distributed service development in the Swedish public transport sector. The contribution to extant research is twofold. Firstly, based on an inductive analysis, three OGD user archetypes are proposed: employees, entrepreneurs and hobbyists. Secondly, the study finds that the significance of distinct innovation barriers varies across phases of the services' lifecycles and depending on the OGD users' motivation, objective, pre-conditions and approach. Drawing on these insights, we propose that OGD initiatives aimed at facilitating outbound OI to a greater extent should address the barriers that appear during diffusion of innovations, the barriers that are not directly related to the OGD provision, and the barriers that are experienced by non-obvious OGD user groups. © 2018-IOS Press and the authors.

    abstract = {Open Government is en vogue, yet vague: while practitioners, policy-makers, and others praise its virtues, little is known about how Open Government relates to bureaucratic organization. This paper presents insights from a qualitative investigation into the City of Vienna, Austria. It demonstrates how the encounter between the city administration and “the open” juxtaposes the decentralizing principles of the crowd, such as transparency, participation, and distributed cognition, with the centralizing principles of bureaucracy, such as secrecy, expert knowledge, written files, and rules. The paper explores how this theoretical conundrum is played out and how senior city managers perceive Open Government in relation to the bureaucratic nature of their administration. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to empirically trace the complexities of the encounter between bureaucracy and Open Government; and second, to critically theorize the ongoing rationalization of public administration in spite of constant challenges to its bureaucratic principles. In so doing, the paper advances our understanding of modern bureaucratic organizations under the condition of increased openness, transparency, and interaction with their environments. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

    abstract = {The use of Open Government Data (OGD) has not kept pace with the expectations as existing OGD infrastructures mainly serve as data repositories. Many OGD infrastructures do not stimulate or support OGD use processes, and there is a lack of research regarding which functionalities can stimulate such processes. The objective of this study is to use a design science approach to evaluate whether metadata, interaction mechanisms, and data quality indicators can improve OGD use. OGD use comprises five main activities, namely searching for and finding OGD, OGD analysis, visualizing OGD, interacting about OGD, and OGD quality analysis. We expect that three OGD key infrastructure elements—metadata, interaction mechanisms, and data quality indicators—allow for improving these five OGD use activities. A prototype of an advanced OGD infrastructure was created, which implements the three OGD infrastructure elements. Three quasi-experiments with a pretest posttest control group design were conducted. The quasi-experiments showed that the prototype facilitated the usability of the novel OGD use functionalities. Our quasi-experiments supported our propositions that metadata, interaction mechanisms, and data quality indicators contribute to making OGD use easier and faster, and enhance the user experience. The infrastructure elements improved OGD use by better enabling searching, analyzing, visualizing, discussing, giving feedback on, and assessing the quality of open data. Hence, we plea for integrating metadata, interaction mechanisms, and data quality indicators in open data infrastructures to advance open data usage. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.},

Open data are often associated with realizing ambitions, such as a more transparent and efficient government, solving societal problems and increased economic value. However, between proposing an open data policy and successful implementation are some practicable obstacles, especially for government agencies required to generate sufficient revenue to cover their operating costs, so-called self-funding agencies. With lost revenue due to open data, there is a real risk that the update frequency and the quality of data may suffer or that the open data policy may even have to be reversed. This article has researched the financial effects of open data policies for self-funding agencies on their business model.

    abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) reflects the socioeconomic development of a nation. The IMR was reduced by 28% between 2015 and 2016 (National Family Health Survey-4 [NFHS-4]) as compared to 2005–2006 (NFHS-3), from 57/1000 to 41/1000 live births. The target fixed by the Government of India for IMR in 2019 is 28/1000 live births (National Health Policy, 2017). One of the most common methods of forecasting this is the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. A forecast of IMR can help implementation of interventions to reduce the burden of infant mortality within the target range. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The objective of the study was to give a detailed explanation of ARIMA model to forecast the IMR (2017–2025). Secondary data analysis and forecast were done for the available year and IMR data extracted from “open government data platform India” website. RESULTS: The forecast of the sample period (1971–2016) showed accuracy by the selected ARIMA (2, 1, 1) model. The postsample forecast with ARIMA (2, 1, 1) showed a decreasing trend of IMR (2017–2025). The forecast IMR for 2025 is 15/1000 live births. CONCLUSION: In the current study, long-time series IMR data were used to forecast the IMR for 9 years. The data showed that IMR would decline from 33/1000 live births in 2017 to 15/1000 live births in 2025. When the actual data for another year (2017) are available, the model can be checked for validity and a more accurate forecast can be performed. © 2019 Journal of Family and Community Medicine.},

    abstract = {One essential characteristic of open data ecosystems is their development through feedback loops, discussions and dynamic data users-suppliers interactions. These user-centric features communicate the users’ needs to the open data community as well to the public sector organizations responsible for data publication. Addressing these needs by the corresponding public sector organizations, or even by utilising the power of the community, can significantly promote and accelerate innovation. However, such elements appear barely to be part of existing open data practices in the public sector. In this paper we describe and discuss an open data platform, which contributes to filling this gap, by providing Web 2.0 functionality that supports and intensifies open data users-suppliers interactions, and then we present a usage scenario of it, explaining the sequence of using its functionality. The discussed open data infrastructure combines functionalities that aim to close the feedback loop and to return information to public authorities that can be useful for better government data opening and publication, as well as for establishing communication channels between all stakeholders that fosters their collaboration. This may effectively lead to the stimulation and facilitation of value generation from open data, as such functionality positions the user at the centre of the open data publication process. © 2014, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

    abstract = {This paper builds on the data designer (government) and local data-user concepts in terms of “technological duality.” This model applies Orlikowski’s structurational model of technology that extends basic ideas about interactions of organizations and information communication technology (ICT). The model is supported by its application to multiple interpretative case studies of the Philippine Open Government initiative. It was evidenced that open government data as a technology is subjective—understood and interpreted inconsistently by the government and data users and therefore creates a disconnect between them. Based on the cases presented, it is proposed that a two-way open governance model will be a more effective approach in developing a truly open government. This reinforces the role of user-side stakeholders as they have the interest, expertise, and resources to utilize open data and can therefore build networks with more users within their respective fields that government initiatives may not be able to reach. © 2019, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

    abstract = {Many countries currently maintain a national data catalog, which provides access to the available datasets – sometimes via an Application Programming Interface (API). These APIs play a crucial role in realizing the benefits of open data as they are the means by which data is discovered and accessed by applications that make use of it. This article proposes semantic APIs as a way of improving access to open data. A semantic API helps to retrieve datasets according to their type (e.g., sensor, climate, finance), and facilitates reasoning about and learning from data. The article examines categories of open datasets from 40 European open data catalogs to gather some insights into types of datasets which should be considered while building semantic APIs for open government data. The results show that the probability of inter-country agreement between open data catalogs is less than 30 percent, and that few categories stand out as candidates for a transnational semantic API. They stress the need for coordination-at the local, regional, and national level-between data providers of Germany, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. © 2016, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

    abstract = {The huge number of heterogeneous and not standardized websites where public records are disclosed is an evidence of how unprepared governments are about Open Government Data movement. This scenario is seen all over the world, especially in organizations which open data principles are new e.g. local governments. Thus, not effective law enforcement and the lack of openness result in a waste of resources applied to useless publication of documents, making it hard to achieve the benefits of open data. Looking for a way to help government at this hardworking task, this paper proposes a software architecture for structuring information into open data from distributed repositories placed at local governments websites. This work follows Attribute-Driven Design (ADD) methodology, where the requirement analysis for proposed architecture has been conducted based on availability problems occurred in 561 websites from Brazilian cities. The main contribution of this paper is the proposition of an architecture whose dissemination and instantiation will allow society to focus efforts on more important tasks e.g. review data consistency, making it possible in a near future to automatize the structuring process in a way that data can be used for any purpose. © 2018 Andreiwid Sheffer Correa, P.L.P.

Portals allowing users to search legal documents, through keyword queries, are now widespread. However, legal documents are mainly stored and offered in different sources and formats that do not facilitate semantic machine-readable techniques, thus making difficult for legal stakeholders to acquire, modify or interlink legal knowledge. In this paper, we describe Solon, a legal document management platform. It offers advanced modelling, managing and mining functions over legal sources, so as to facilitate access to legal knowledge. It utilizes a novel method for extracting semantic representations of legal sources from unstructured formats, such as PDF and HTML text files, interlinking and enhancing them with classification features. At the same time, utilizing the structure and specific features of legal sources, it provides refined search results. Finally, it allows users to connect and explore legal resources according to their individual needs. To demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of our approach, Solon has been successfully deployed in a public sector production environment, making Greek tax legislation easily accessible to the public. Opening up legislation in this way will help increase transparency and make governments more accountable to citizens. © 2018 by the authors.},

Furthermore, the open government and data initiative has led many local authorities to make these datasets publicly available, hoping to drive innovation that will further improve the quality of life for the city-dwellers. In this paper, we develop a novel application that utilizes crime data to provide safe urban navigation. Specifically, using crime data from Chicago and Philadelphia we develop a risk model for their street urban network, which allows us to estimate the relative probability of a crime on any road segment. Given such model we define two variants of the SafePaths problem where the goal is to find a short and low-risk path between a source and a destination location. Since both the length and the risk of the path are equally important but cannot be combined into a single objective, we approach the urban-navigation problem as a biobjective shortest path problem. Our algorithms aim to output a small set of paths that provide tradeoffs between distance and safety. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms and their practical applicability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the literature on the types, effects, conditions and user of Open Government Data (OGD). The review analyses 101 academic studies about OGD which discuss at least one of the four factors of OGD utilization: the different types of utilization, the effects of utilization, the key conditions, and the different users. Our analysis shows that the majority of studies focus on the OGD provisions while assuming, but not empirically testing, various forms of utilization. The paper synthesizes the hypothesized relations in a multi-dimensional framework of OGD utilization. Based on the framework we suggest four future directions for research: 1) investigate the link between type of utilization and type of users (e.g. journalists, citizens) 2) investigate the link between type of user and type of effect (e.g. societal, economic and good governance benefits) 3) investigate the conditions that moderate OGD effects (e.g. policy, data quality) and 4) establishing a causal link between utilization and OGD outcomes. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

Therefore, they are naturally drafted in a technical way with the aim of being interpreted legally. In this paper, however, we present a series of automatic transformations applied to the framework of federal laws in order to structure the information described in these documents with the aim of preparing them for different types of automatic interpretations, such as identification of named entities, definitions, references, creation, alteration and closure events of legal institutions, recovery of the current version of a law in time. This aims to support information activities that go beyond legal interpretation itself, aligned with Open Government Data.

In addition, organization level models have neglected to explain the role of management in decision-making processes about technology and data. This article contributes to addressing this gap in the literature by analyzing the complex relationships between open government data characteristics and the organizations and institutions in which they are embedded. We systematically compare the open data inception and implementation processes, as well as their main results, in three Spanish local governments (Gava and Rubi in Catalonia and Gijon in Asturias) by using a model that combines the technology enactment framework with some specific constructs and relationships from the process model of computing change. Our resulting model is able to identify and explain the significant role of management in shaping and mediating different interactions, but also acknowledges the importance of organizational level variables and the context in which the open data initiative is taking place. © 2018, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

    abstract = {Background: Open health data has implications for clinical care, research, public health, and health policy at regional, national and global levels. No published attempts have been made to determine, collectively, whether World Health Organization (WHO) member states and governments have embraced the promise and effort required to officially share open health data. The observational study will provide evidence that WHO member states individually and collectively have adopted open data recommended principles, providing access to open health data. Methods: Using the WHO list of member states (n=194), the researchers identified the presence of open health data or initiatives. With each country, the following types of official government web pages were recorded: a Ministry of Health web page; a conspicuous link on a government web page to open health data; additional government health web sites; national government-sponsored open data repositories; unique attributes of national health data web sites; and adherence to the principles of open government data for health. A supplemental PDF file provides a representation of data used for analysis and observations. Our complete data is available at: https://goo.gl/Kwj7mb Observations and Discussion: Open health data is easily discoverable in less than one-third of the WHO member states. 13 nations demonstrate the principle to provide comprehensive open data. Only 16 nations distribute primary, non-aggregated health data. 24% of the WHO observed member states are providing some health data in a non-proprietary formats such as comma-separated values. The sixth, seventh and eighth open government data principles for health, representing universal access, non-proprietary formats, and non-patent protection, are observed in about one-third of the WHO member states. While there are examples of organised national open health data, no more than a one-third minority of the world’s nations have portals set up to systematically share open health data. At least 15 WHO member states are observed to not even have a government health ministry representation online. Conclusions: We hope the data collected in our Google Sheet and the discussion provided in this paper will generate international interest and advocacy for open health data. © 2016, Prex S.p.A.

    abstract = {Purpose - The aim of this paper is to describe a local government effort to realise an open government agenda. This is done using a storytelling approach. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical data are based on a case study. The authors participated in, as well as followed, the process of realising an open government agenda on a local level, where citizens were invited to use open public data as the basis for developing apps and external Web solutions. Based on an interpretative tradition, they chose storytelling as a way to scrutinise the competition process. In this paper, they present a story about the competition process using the story elements put forward by Kendall and Kendall (2012). Findings - The research builds on existing research by proposing the myth that the “public” wants to make use of open data. The authors provide empirical insights into the challenge of gaining benefits from open public data. In particular, they illustrate the difficulties in getting citizens interested in using open public data. Their case shows that people seem to like the idea of open public data, but do not necessarily participate actively in the data reuse process. Research limitations/implications - The results are based on one empirical study. Further research is, therefore, needed. The authors would especially welcome more studies that focus on citizens’ interest and willingness to reuse open public data. Practical implications - This study illustrates the difficulties of promoting the reuse of open public data. Public organisations that want to pursue an open government agenda can use these findings as empirical insights. Originality/value - This paper answers the call for more empirical studies on public open data. Furthermore, it problematises the “myth” of public interest in the reuse of open public data. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

In this article, we shed light on two elements that many “smart cities” claim to integrate: open data and collaborative/participatory governance. Notably, we investigate whether the common claim in the smart city literature that open data can promote more participative and collaborative forms of governance passes the test of additional theoretical interrogation. We criticize that while this literature has noticed the importance of participation and collaboration, the meaning of the concepts has remained vague. Therefore, we introduce a concrete yet comprehensive framework of collaborative governance from which we derive three theoretical assumptions regarding the potential influence of open data on collaborative processes in a smart city context: overcoming knowledge asymmetries, facilitating joint fact finding and enabling trust building. We conclude by outlining how our theoretical framework could guide further empirical research on the exact relation of smart cities, collaborative governance and open government data. © 2014, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

This research focuses on the cases of three US states-Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. We examine the stated goals of each portal and any policies related to their establishment or upkeep. We then examine the portals with regard to updating, reuse, organization and other factors. Of the three cases, Vermont’s portal is moderately successful and continues to be used. New Hampshire’s strategy of linking to data on agency websites is inconsistent, but the state law requiring data published to be in open formats does mean data is more open when it is provided. Maine’s portal went dormant soon after its initial creation, and was fully taken down in the timeframe of this research. These cases illustrate that the establishment of a state portal alone does not guarantee that the portal will support the desired outcomes. © 2019, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

We expect related developments to provide benefits for communication professions like civic education and political journalism, and to enhance methods for cross-domain exploration and reasoning for linked open government data.

    abstract = {In the last few years, Brazilian municipal governments have launched their open data web portals. These initiatives have been taking place as part of the implementation of the Transparency Act, which sets forth deadlines and punishments concerning the adoption and performance of steps that focus on government transparency, such as the presence of transparency portals. Accordingly, this paper aims to check whether municipalities that keep portals with higher a Digital Transparency Index (DTI) will also prove to have the strongest open data initiatives. In order to achieve this goal we assess the official portals and open data initiatives in five Brazilian capitals by using the methodologies proposed by Paula Amorim (2012), and the prerequisites pointed out by the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF, 2011), and Tim Berners-Lee (2010). The results indicate that there is no direct relationship between the Digital Transparency Index and the strength of open data actions in each municipality. The discussion of the results points to the absence of a concise public policy on digital democracy that is able to promote transparency and government data simultaneously. © 2016, University of Zagreb.

Peled’s book Traversing Digital Babel proposes an innovative solution to improve information sharing inside government by using selective incentives to nudge government officials to exchange data in an automated Public Sector Information Exchange (PSIE). Enabled by grants from Google and Yissum, Peled embarked on the first step to creating a testable PSIE prototype: building the world’s first fully-automated corpus of metadata about Open Government Data (OGD) released by local and national governmental agencies worldwide. The OGD corpus currently contains metadata about information assets from 24 different countries, and presents rich opportunities for research including examining and comparing government patterns of information release. The corpus could also enable an innovative model of combined free and for-payment government data release. © 2015, Department for E-Governance and Administration. All rights reserved.},

Level 1, Way of Life, indicates high commitment to OGD; Level 2, On the Fence, represents either a low or erratic commitment; Level 3, Lip Service, refers to either scarce or no commitment. This study shows that these types exhibit distinct behavior in four key indicators: (1) Rhythm, (2) Coverage, (3) Categorization, and (4) Feedback. This theoretical framework is examined using longitudinal mixed-method analysis of the OGD behavior of 16 US cities over a period of four years, using a corpus of municipal quantitative metadata and primary qualitative data. This methodology allows us to represent, for the first time, cities’ evolving OGD commitment, or “OGD heartbeat”. © 2015, Department for E-Governance and Administration. All rights reserved.},

We examined 269 articles between 2010 and 2015, that were retrieved through keyword searches of the Scopus database and four ICT4D journals. This article adopts the pathway of effects model to analyze contributions according to inputs, mechanisms and outputs of open initiatives in LMICs. The review finds a fairly even spread of articles across the three stages of effects. Studies that disentangled reasons why or why not openness makes a difference provided the most insight to underlying mechanisms and impact of open initiatives. We found very little evidence that research within this area is concerned with the perspectives of poor and marginalized people - notably women. We therefore question the normative value of open development as a means to transform power relations. However, we argue that a more concentrated vision within this field is needed to exploit the full potential of digitally enabled openness for development.},

It shows that research on open data has grown rapidly since 2009 with the development of various open data initiatives. We identify the different themes using science mapping and performance analysis. The most important themes are semantic web, open government, and crowdsourcing. The basic and transversal themes are data sharing and public sector information. As for the emerging themes, these are Big Data and open government data. In addition, data journalism, monitoring, and recommender systems are specific themes that deserve special attention. The UK and the USA are the leading publishing countries, both in theoretical and practical research on open data. In China, most researchers focus on practical research, and there have been efforts to promote the development of open data. Papers introducing large-scale projects receive more attention and citation quickly. Recently, researchers have been publishing more on objective topics, including possible issues and dilemmas in the era of Big Data and many problems such as budgets, ownership, licensing, culture, and sustainable development. © 2017 The Author(s).

    abstract = {Citizen participation for social innovation and co-creating urban regeneration proposals can be greatly facilitated by innovative IT systems. Such systems can use Open Government Data, visualise urban proposals in 3D models and provide automated feedback on the feasibility of the proposals. Using such a system as a communication platform between citizens and city administrations provides an integrated top-down and bottom-up urban planning and decision-making approach to smart cities. However, generating automated feedback on citizens' proposals requires modelling domain-specific knowledge i.e., vocabulary and rules, which can be applied on spatial and temporal 3D models. This paper presents the European Commission funded H2020 smarticipate project that aims to achieve the above challenge by applying it on three smart cities: Hamburg, Rome and RBKC-London. Whilst the proposed system architecture indicates various innovative features, a proof of concept of the automated feedback feature for the Hamburg use case 'planting trees' is demonstrated. Early results and lessons learned show that it is feasible to provide automated feedback on citizen-initiated proposals on specific topics. However, it is not straightforward to generalise this feature to cover more complex concepts and conditions which require specifying comprehensive domain languages, rules and appropriate tools to process them. This paper also highlights the strengths of the smarticipate platform, discusses challenges to realise its different features and suggests potential solutions. © 2017 by the authors.},

We argue that current open data platforms do not take into account the complexity of democratic processes which results in overly simplistic approaches to open data platform design. Democratic processes are multifaceted and open data can be used for various purposes, with diverging roles, rules and tools by citizens and public administrators. This study develops a Democratic Activity Model of Open Data Use, which is illustrated by an exploratory qualitative multiple case study outlining three democratic processes: monitorial, deliberative and participatory. We find that each type of democratic process requires a different approach and open data design. We conclude that a context-sensitive open data design facilitates the transformation of raw data into meaningful information constructed collectively by public administrators and citizens. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

This construct, called DECIDE, was based on four indicators related to administrative burden reduction, democracy, institutional quality and open government data, represented respectively by Global Open Data Index, Democracy Index, Ease of doing Business Raking, and Institutional Quality Index. These four indicators were analysed with the Corruption Perception Index (CPI). A database was created that was analyzed following all the requirements of the technique Partial Least Squares (PLS). The main result was the creation of DECIDE, which explains 50% of the CPI's perception of corruption during these years. The DECIDE, in turn, is explained by the four indicators. This construct provides a foundation for the context to be less conducive to corruption while broadening protection mechanisms. In practical terms, the study identifies that a less bureaucratic, more democratic, more transparent country where institutions work best is more protected from corruption, whereas these four variables act as a deterrent to corruption. © 2019 FEA-RP/USP.

    abstract = {As a consequence of policies such as the EU Public Sector Initiative, authorities across Europe have been moving towards providing free access to a wide range of statistical data and in particular geodata. From the diverse end-users' perspective (general public, interest groups, students, other authorities, etc.), access to data requires specific knowledge, methods, and guidance in identifying and using the relevant content. Metadata are a key concept for the description and classification of data and thus also for ensuring their long-term value. We analyze the European Data Portal as well as one national metadatabase (Austrian Data Portal) with regard to aspects such as data search functionality, keyword consistency, spatial referencing, data format and data license information. In both cases, we found extensive inconsistencies and conceptual weaknesses that heavily limit the practical accessibility. The mere presence of metadata is no indicator for the usability of the data. We argue for a better definition and structuring of the interface between the numerous data providers and the metadatabases. © 2018 by the authors.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to derive design principles for improving the open data publishing process of public organizations. Although governments create large amounts of data, the publication of open data is often cumbersome and there are no standard procedures and processes for opening data, blocking the easy publication of government data. Design/methodology/approach: Action design research (ADR) was used to derive design principles. The literature was used as a foundation, and discussion sessions with civil servants were used to evaluate the usefulness of the principles. Findings: Barriers preventing easy and low-cost publication of open data were identified and connected to design principles, which can be used to guide the design of an open data publishing process. Five new principles are: start thinking about the opening of data at the beginning of the process; develop guidelines, especially about privacy and policy sensitivity of data; provide decision support by integrating insight in the activities of other actors involved in the publishing process; make data publication an integral, well-defined and standardized part of daily procedures and routines; and monitor how the published data are reused. Research limitations/implications: The principles are derived using ADR in a single case. A next step can be to investigate multiple comparative case studies and detail the principles further. We recommend using these principles to develop a reference architecture. Practical implications: The design principles can be used by public organizations to improve their open data publishing processes. The design principles are derived from practice and discussed with practitioners. The discussions showed that the principles could improve the publication process. Social implications: Decreasing the barriers for publishing open government data could result in the publication of more open data. These open data can then be used to stimulate various public values, such as transparency, accountability, innovation, economic growth and informed decision- and policymaking. Originality/value: Publishing data by public organizations is a complex and ill-understood activity. The lack of suitable business processes and the unclear division of responsibilities block publication of open data. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting design principles which can be used to improve the open data publishing process of public sector organizations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Open Government Data (OGD) is the term used since 2007 to refer to open government data, that is, public data produced or commissioned by the public sector, available on the internet for free use. The availability of OGD was encouraged by initiatives for disclosure of data carried out in 2009 by the United States of America and these initiatives were developed in several countries. However, with the amount of public information disclosed by governments, the idea of open content has been increasingly associated to access to information. In Brazil, plans that regard information policies do not establish a standard with guidelines or models for OGD publication. Thus, in the absence of metrics to evaluate the initiatives of data openness by the Brazilian government and its reuse, this article presents the Brazilian metric DGABr, one of the results of a doctoral research. DGABr is a proposed model to evaluate the OGD in the Federal Public Administration of Brazil, based on metrics and international indicators. The experience from other countries regarding OGD evaluation directed the creation of the DGABr; however, Brazil's legislation and information policies had a direct influence on OGD measurements. DGABr is an initial proposal to evaluate Brazil's OGD and their reuse and should evolve with the country's information policy. The proof of concept performed with the metric identified a positive result for the OGD evaluation, allowing validation of the perspectives and dimensions proposed in the metric and its potential reuse indicator. © 2018 Universidade Federal de Campina Grande.
