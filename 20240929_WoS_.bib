Abstract = {Healthcare systems are using big data-driven methods to realize the
   vision of learning health systems and improve care quality. In so doing,
   many are partnering with third-party commercial companies to provide
   novel data processing and analysis capabilities, while also providing
   personal health information to a for-profit industry that may store and
   sell data. In this research we describe the public's comfort with
   sharing health data with third-party commercial companies for patient
   and business purposes and how this comfort is associated with
   demographic factors (sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, employment,
   income, insurance status, and self-reported health status), perceived
   healthcare access, and concerns about privacy. We surveyed the US public
   (n = 1841) to assess comfort with sharing health data with third-party
   commercial companies for patient or business purposes and examined
   whether there was a difference between comfort with data sharing for
   patient or business purposes. Univariate and stepwise regression
   modeling is used here to estimate the relationship between comfort with
   third-party commercial companies for patient and business purposes
   (outcomes) and demographic factors, self-reported health status,
   perceived healthcare access, and privacy concerns. The public is more
   comfortable sharing health data with third party commercial companies
   for patient purposes as compared to business purposes (paired t = 39.84,
   p < 0.001). Higher education was associated with greater comfort with
   sharing health data for patient purposes (beta = 0.205, p < 0.001) and
   decreased comfort with sharing health data for business purposes (beta =
   -0.145, p = 0.079). An inverse relationship exists between privacy
   concerns and comfort with sharing health data for both patient (beta =
   -0.223, p < 0.001) and business purposes (beta = -0.246, p < 0.001).
   Participants ages 45-59 were less comfortable sharing health data with
   third party commercial companies for patient purposes (beta = -0.154, p
   = 0.0012) than participants aged 18-29. Proactive acknowledgment of
   privacy concerns and better communication of the steps being taken to
   protect the privacy of health data can increase patient comfort.
   Healthcare systems may be able to increase public and patient comfort
   with sharing health data with third-party commercial companies by
   emphasizing the patient-centered benefits of these partnerships.},

Title = {Linking pre- and post-adoption records for research in anonymised form
   in a data safe haven: legal implications and support for a social
   licence},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POPULATION DATA SCIENCE (IJPDS)},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Introduction
   The long-term health and wellbeing of adoptees is under-researched. One
   reason for this has been limited data accessibility regarding the
   adoption process, and another is a practice common in some UK
   jurisdictions of changing the National Health Service (NHS) number (or
   equivalent) at adoption, as part of creating the new identity. The SAIL
   Databank holds data on child and family court cases from Cafcass Cymru,
   together with children's social care data, and can link these with
   routine health and administrative data in anonymised form. However,
   because the linkage key at SAIL is based on an encryption of the NHS
   number, working with pre- and post-adoption records for longitudinal
   research remains a major challenge. We set out to explore the legal
   implications of, and social support for, linking these records for use
   in anonymised form for longitudinal research.
   Methods
   We reviewed the main legislation and regulations governing the use of
   data about adoptees in England and Wales. We gauged support for a social
   licence in Wales by carrying out interviews with individuals who had
   been involved in the adoptions process, and by engaging with general
   public groups for their views. We drew out the main emerging themes and,
   in combination with the review, propose a way forward.
   Results
   The legal review indicated that there are provisions in the Family
   Procedure Rules (England and Wales) and the General Data Protection
   Regulation that can be relied upon for the lawful processing of adoption
   data into anonymised form for research. The main points of concern about
   linking pre- and post-adoption records were privacy, data security, the
   need to limit the number of organisations involved in data sharing, and
   re-identification risk. The over-riding message was favourable with
   longitudinal research seen as strongly beneficial.
   Conclusion
   This study has indicated that in Wales, there is no legal impediment,
   nor major objection from individuals involved in the adoptions process,
   or members of the general public, for the use of adoption data in
   anonymised form in a data safe haven. This includes the linkage of pre-
   and post-adoption records to enable novel longitudinal research to take
   place. The provisos were that robust safeguards must be in place, and
   that the research should aim to benefit adoptees and to improve policy
   and practice. We conclude that it is reasonable to proceed with caution
   to develop practical ways to link pre- and post-adoption records in a
   data safe haven.},

Title = {Developing a population data science approach to assess increased risk
   of COVID-19 associated with attending large events},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POPULATION DATA SCIENCE (IJPDS)},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Introduction
   In summer 2021, as rates of COVID-19 decreased and social restrictions
   were relaxed, live entertainment and sporting events were resumed. In
   order to inform policy on the safe re-introduction of spectator events,
   a number of test events were organised in Wales, ranging in setting,
   size and audience.
   Objectives
   To design and test a method to assess whether test events were
   associated with an increase in risk of confirmed COVID-19, in order to
   inform policy.
   Methods
   We designed a cohort study with fixed follow-up time and measured
   relative risk of confirmed COVID-19 in those attending two large
   sporting events. First, we linked ticketing information to individual
   records on the Welsh Demographic Service (WDS), a register of all people
   living in Wales and registered with a GP, and identified NHS numbers for
   attendees. Where NHS numbers were not found we used combinations of
   other identifiers such as email, name, postcode and/or mobile number. We
   then linked attendees to routine SARS-CoV-2 test data to calculate
   positivity rates in people attending each event for the period one to
   fourteen days following the event. We selected a comparison cohort from
   WDS for each event, individually matched by age band, gender and
   locality of residence. As many people attended events in family groups
   we explored the possibility of also matching on household clusters
   within the comparison group. Risk ratios were then computed for the two
   events.
   Results
   We successfully assigned NHS numbers to 91\% and 84\% of people
   attending the two events respectively. Other identifiers were available
   for the remainder. Only a small number of attendees (<10) had a record
   of confirmed COVID-19 following attendance at each event (14 day
   cumulative incidence: 36 and 26 per 100,000, respectively). There was no
   evidence of significantly increased risk of COVID-19 at either event.
   However, the event that didn't include pre-event testing in their
   mitigations, had a higher risk ratio (3.0 compared to 0.3).
   Conclusions
   We demonstrate the potential for using population data science methods
   to inform policy. We conclude that, at that point in the epidemic, and
   with the mitigations that were in place, attending large outdoor
   sporting events did not significantly increase risk of COVID-19.
   However, these analyses were carried out between epidemic waves when
   background incidence and testing rate was low, and need to be repeated
   during periods of greater transmission. Having a mechanism to identify
   attendees at events is necessary to calculate risk and feasibility and
   acceptability of data sharing should be considered.},
