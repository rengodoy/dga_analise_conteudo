	abstract = {The 2019 European Open Data Directive identifies geospatial data as data that could have a major impact on human activities (high-value data, HVD) and advocates its provision as open data (OD), i.e., without barriers to access and re-use. Although Croatia has implemented OD policies to support the provision of open data, many geospatial data are still not available, or if available, their level of openness ranks Croatia lower than Slovenia and Serbia on some ranking lists. Benchmarking tools have proven to be a powerful tool in identifying barriers in OD. This paper, therefore, benchmarks the level of openness and provision of geospatial HVD in Croatia, Slovenia and Serbia, using the extended and modified Global Open Data Index methodology (GODI Plus). It is expected that this will provide an answer to the status of OD policies and government engagement in OD in Croatia and identify good OD practices among the three countries analyzed. Furthermore, the results will be a baseline benchmark for future HVD analyses. The results reveal low data openness for Croatia and Serbia, high data openness for Slovenia, and a low level of government engagement in all three proposed countries. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Environmental assessments (EAs) in Botswana are insufficiently influential in decision-making and have been criticised for contributing to extended transaction costs and timelines. Therefore, efforts to simplify EA have been undertaken. Whilst internationally, the value of EA is judged by its capability to raise the profile of environmental issues and enhance public participation in decision processes, current EA simplification interventions in Botswana aim at constraining access to environmental information, at reducing public participation provisions and at restricting the scope of environmental impacts to be evaluated. Ultimately, EA is intended to be replaced with outcome-based tools aiming to mitigate and compensate for environmental damage rather than avoiding it. The authors therefore suggest that simplification efforts in Botswana are bound to erode benefits associated with EA and are not fit for purpose. In this paper, three recommendations are offered: whilst outcome-based tools can be prepared for projects that were assessed by EA they must be firmly tiered to them. Furthermore, discretion in decision-making needs to remain in place, and data sharing should be enhanced by placing EA reports in the public domain. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Purpose: The opening of government data is high on the policy agenda of governments worldwide. However, data release faces barriers due to limited support of civil servants, whereas the literature neglects civil servants' role in opening data. This paper aims at understanding why civil servants can be reluctant to support the disclosure of data. The authors developed a model to explain civil servants' behavioral intention to open data. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test a series of hypotheses by collecting and analyzing survey data from 387 civil servants and by applying multivariate hierarchical regression. Findings: The results indicate the factors influencing the behavior of civil servants. Social influences, performance expectancy, data management knowledge and risks have a significant influence. Personal characteristics control these effects. Research limitations/implications: Caution is needed to generalize the findings towards the support to open data provision by civil servants. Though the analyzed sample was limited to Brazil, other countries and cultures might yield different outcomes. Larger and more diversified samples might indicate significant effects on variables not found in this research. Practical implications: The insights can be used to develop policies for increasing the support of civil servants towards governmental data disclosure. Originality/value: This study suggests factors of influence to civil servants' behavior intentions to disclose governmental data. It results in a model of factors, specifically for their behavioral intention at the individual level. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Most archaeological investigations in the United States and other countries must comply with preservation laws, especially if they are on government property or supported by government funding. Academic and cultural resource management (CRM) studies have explored various social, temporal, and environmental contexts and produce an ever-increasing volume of archaeological data. More and more data are born digital, and many legacy data are digitized. There is a building effort to synthesize and integrate data at a massive scale and create new data standards and management systems. Taxpayer dollars often fund archaeological studies that are intended, in spirit, to promote historic preservation and provide public benefits. However, the resulting data are difficult to access and interoperationalize, and they are rarely collected and managed with their long-term security, accessibility, and ethical reuse in mind. Momentum is building toward open data and open science as well as Indigenous data sovereignty and governance. The field of archaeology is reaching a critical point where consideration of diverse constituencies, concerns, and requirements is needed to plan data collection and management approaches moving forward. This theme issue focuses on challenges and opportunities in archaeological data collection and management in academic and CRM contexts. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

	abstract = {The effective and ethical use of data to inform decision-making offers huge value to the public sector, especially when delivered by transparent, reproducible, and robust data processing workflows. One way that governments are unlocking this value is through making their data publicly available, allowing more people and organisations to derive insights. However, open data is not enough in many cases: publicly available datasets need to be accessible in an analysis-ready form from popular data science tools, such as R and Python, for them to realise their full potential. This paper explores ways to maximise the impact of open data with reference to a case study of packaging code to facilitate reproducible analysis. We present the jtstats project, which consists of a main Python package, and a smaller R version, for importing, processing, and visualising large and complex datasets representing journey times, for many transport modes and trip purposes at multiple geographic levels, released by the UK Department for Transport (DfT). jtstats shows how domain specific packages can enable reproducible research within the public sector and beyond, saving duplicated effort and reducing the risks of errors from repeated analyses. We hope that the jtstats project inspires others, particularly those in the public sector, to add value to their data sets by making them more accessible. © The Author(s) 2024.},

This manuscript develops research priorities from the findings of a series of interviews and workshops with governmental scientists and regulators from food safety agencies in fifteen jurisdictions globally. The interviews and workshops aimed to identify the key safety questions and priority areas of research. Participants raised questions about which aspects of cultured meat and seafood production are novel, and the implications of the paucity of public information on the topic. Novel parameters and targets may require the development of new analytical methods or adaptation and validation of existing ones, including for a diversity of product types and processes. Participants emphasized that data sharing of these efforts would be valuable, similar to those already developed and used in the food and pharmaceutical fields. Contributions to such databases from the private and public sectors would speed general understanding as well as efforts to make evaluations more efficient. In turn, these resources, combined with transparent risk assessment, will be critical elements of building consumer trust in cultured meat and seafood products. © 2023 by the authors.},

This study investigated the impact of open government data (OGD) on the urban–rural income divide in China. Our theoretical analysis shows that the nonrival nature of data initially widens the urban–rural income divide before eventually mitigating it, resulting in an inverted U-shaped relationship. Using a multiperiod difference-in-differences specification, we found that OGD widened the urban–rural income divide between 2010 and 2019. Furthermore, cities with initially wider urban–rural income divides experienced a greater impact from OGD in expanding this divide. These findings provide valuable insights in the role of open data in addressing income inequality, and contribute to our understanding of data inequalities in the context of the data revolution. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Citizens' acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) in public service delivery is important for its legitimate and effective use by government. Human involvement in AI systems has been suggested as a way to boost citizens' acceptance and perceptions of these systems' fairness. However, there is little empirical evidence to assess these claims. To address this gap, we conducted a pre-registered conjoint experiment in the UK regarding acceptance of AI in processing public permits: for immigration visas and parking permits. We hypothesise that greater human involvement boosts acceptance of AI in decision-making and associated perceptions of its fairness. We further hypothesise that greater human involvement mitigates the negative impact of certain AI features, such as inaccuracy, high cost, or data sharing. From our study, we find that more human involvement tends to increase acceptance, and that perceptions of fairness were less influenced. Yet, when substantial human discretion was introduced in parking permit scenarios, respondents preferred more limited human input. We found little evidence that human involvement moderates the impact of AI's unfavourable attributes. System-level factors such as high accuracy, the presence of an appeals system, increased transparency, reduced cost, non-sharing of data, and the absence of private company involvement all boost both acceptance and perceived procedural fairness. We find limited evidence that individual characteristics affect these results. The findings show how the design of AI systems can increase its acceptability to citizens for use in public services. © 2023 The Author(s)},

It aims to do this by providing a secure and trustworthy technical architecture, a robust data-sharing business model realized through effective governance, and ensuring data sovereignty. Ensuring data sovereignty, however, is challenging when different agents all claim authority over their data within a data space.

In China, with its distinctive institutional characteristics, it is not yet well investigated what kinds of data governance mechanisms are introduced, how data are collected, shared, and used, and how potential risks concerning data security and privacy are addressed. This paper conducts an exploratory study of the case of smart city development in Shenzhen and examines critical opportunities and challenges in data governance. A centralized approach led by the government has been emphasized in data governance, with its focus evolving from addressing the fragmentation of government data to fostering the integration of various kinds of data in society. Open data platforms have been developed through close cooperation between government and technology enterprises. Regulations have been introduced to protect data security and privacy and facilitate the exchange and use of data for innovation. On the other hand, stakeholders are not sufficiently incentivized to provide accurate information. The value of data is not appropriately recognized or measured, discouraging the sharing of data to facilitate the use of data. Citizens are not well-informed about what kinds of data are collected and how these data are used. Institutional mechanisms have not yet been established to ensure that the data collected from citizens are properly handled by the public authorities. It is crucial to encourage citizens’ engagement in data governance to fully implement the people-centered approach to smart city development. © 2023 The Author(s).

We investigate 10 years of consumer reviews in East and Southeast Asia from 2011 to 2021 to enable infrastructure evaluation at a larger geographic scale than previously available. We find evidence that charging stations at government locations result in higher failure rates with consumers compared to charging stations at private points of interest. This evidence contrasts with predictions in the U.S. and European markets, where the performance is closer to parity. We also find that networked stations with communication protocols provide a relatively higher quality of charging services, which favors policy support for connectivity, particularly for underserved or remote areas. © 2023 The Authors},

As part of wider interest in geospatial technologies to inform service provision and settlement upgrading, this study demonstrates the use of freely-available satellite and spatial datasets and accessible remote sensing techniques to track the spatiotemporal dynamics of informal settlements. Focusing on Cape Town over a period of rapid urbanization between 2000 and 2020, this study identified the number, location, and spatial distribution of informal settlements across the city, and the growth and decline in built-up land over time for individual settlements. Key findings include a recent increase in informal land use in Cape Town after a period of decline in the earlier part of the study period, and evidence of the impacts of policy interventions such as settlement upgrading and resident relocation initiatives, including those associated with the N2 Gateway project. By focusing on both the ‘where’ and ‘when’ of informal settlements this study provides important evidence of spatial and temporal dynamics useful for governments and grassroots actors alike, and demonstrates the potential of an accessible method that can be implemented without significant resources or technical expertise. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {In the event of a crisis, such as COVID-19, the decisions and subsequent actions taken by the local government are one of the primary sources of support to the local population. Yet the processes through which these decisions are reached and the data engineering advancements made for and during events are poorly reported. Understanding the capabilities and constraints in which city officials operate is essential for impactful academic research alongside global city comparison and discussion on best practices in reaching optimal and data-informed decisions. This is especially pertinent for the global South, where informality in housing and the economy presents further challenges to appropriate resource distribution in a crisis. Here, we present insights into the City of Cape Town’s data-driven response and subsequent data engineering and analytical developments throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This is based upon a review of internal documentation including a close-out report which summarised semi-structured interviews with staff involved in the data work stream. The paper reports on the deliverables produced during 2020 by the data work stream and outlines specific challenges the city faced and its data-informed response in the areas of (1) quantifying costs for COVID-19 initiatives, (2) dealing with a surge in fatalities, (3) guiding scarce public resources to respond to an evolving crisis, and (4) data sharing. We demonstrate the real-term value of incorporating data into the decision-making process and conclude by outlining key factors that cities and researchers must consider as a part of the usual business to effectively assist their populations during times of stress and crisis. © 2023 by the authors.},

For this, qualitative research was carried out, based on open data from the government of Brazil, and Mexico, with 58 states being evaluated, being 27 Brazilian states and 31 Mexican states. The information was collected and analyzed using the Iramuteq 2.0 software. The results showed that in both countries the states adopted different measures in response to the impacts of COVID-19, in which Mexico stands out that adopted: vehicle tax extensions and negotiation measures, 100\% discount on the vehicle tax in the purchase of used vehicles, reduction of the lodging tax for tourist states, exemption of 100\% from the housing tax and incentives for the payment of expenses with workers. In Brazil, several tax incentive measures were adopted between the states, such as: tax exemptions, extensions and installment payments for all taxes. The research allows discussing strategies aimed at identifying the measures adopted by the countries' state governments, with the limitation of adopting lhe necessary instruments to discuss the recovery of local economies and public finances. © 2023 Centro Universitario de Brasilia.

	abstract = {One of the drivers for pushing for open data as a form of corruption control stems from the belief that in making government operations more transparent, it would be possible to hold public officials accountable for how public resources are spent. These large datasets would then be open to the public for scrutiny and analysis, resulting in lower levels of corruption. Though data quality has been largely studied and many advancements have been made, it has not been extensively applied to open data, with some aspects of data quality receiving more attention than others. One key aspect however - accuracy - seems to have been overlooked. This gap resulted in our inquiry: how is accurate open data produced and how might breakdowns in this process introduce opportunities for corruption? We study a government agency situated within the Brazilian Federal Government in order to understand in what ways is accuracy compromised. Adopting a distributed cognition (DCog) theoretical framework, we found that the production of open data is not a neutral activity, instead it is a distributed process performed by individuals and artifacts. This distributed cognitive process creates opportunities for data to be concealed and misrepresented. Two models mapping data production were generated, the combination of which provided an insight into how cognitive processes are distributed, how data flow, are transformed, stored, and processed, and what instances provide opportunities for data inaccuracies and misrepresentations to occur. The results obtained have the potential to aid policymakers in improving data accuracy. © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.},

	abstract = {The analysis of contemporary society, characterized by technological, economic, political, social, and cultural changes, has become more challenging due to the development of the internet and information and communication technologies, which provide a vast and increasingly valuable source of information, knowledge, and data. Within this context, so-called open data—that is, data that are made public, especially by public administrations, through an open governance model (transparent and accessible to citizens) are assuming a significant role. This is a topic of growing importance that scientific research is addressing in an attempt to discern the multiplicity of social, educational, legal, technological, statistical, and methodological issues that underlie the creation and use of such data. This article aims to provide insights into understanding scientific trends on the topic of open data through a bibliometric approach. Specifically, a total of 3,110 publications related to the disciplinary fields of the social sciences and humanities published from 2013 to 2022 were collected. The data was then analyzed using network and factorial analysis techniques to detect the conceptual structure to identify the trends of topics and perspectives of research that characterize open data studies.

	abstract = {Purpose — This study explores the perspectives of key figures from Islamic boarding schools (Kiai Pesantren) in Depok City, Indonesia, regarding the efforts to promote fiscal transparency, participation and accountability (FTPA) by the government for enhancing taxpayer compliance. Design/Methodology/Approach — This study is based on the interpretivist paradigm. Keywords related to Muslims’ obligations, zakat and taxes were sourced to find relevant literature. A thematic analysis was conducted of in-depth interview data from Kiai Pesantren regarding their perspectives on state fund management. Findings — The results show the importance of FTPA in state fund management, especially when aligned with Islamic principles. Fiscal transparency involves directing tax funds towards poverty alleviation alongside infrastructure development. The involvement of religious organisations can be aimed at fostering moral responsibility among officials, while citizen participation can be facilitated through open data for budget planning. The accountability of public officials must be accompanied by efforts to minimise corruption and enforce strict punishments for corrupt activities. Moreover, fully crediting zakat payments for Muslim taxpayers could improve tax compliance, but this requires assurance through future policy reforms. Originality/Value — This study contributes to the literature by integrating Islamic principles into the framework of FTPA. Research Limitations/Implications — Broader insights into tax compliance management and support for Sharīʿah-based taxation could be addressed by involving Islamic scholars across countries. © Prianto Budi Saptono and Ismail Khozen.},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the discoverability of supporting research materials, including supporting documents, individual participant data (IPD), and associated publications, in US federally funded COVID-19 clinical study records in ClinicalTrials.gov (CTG). Methods: Study registration records were evaluated for (1) links to supporting documents, including protocols, informed consent forms, and statistical analysis plans; (2) information on how unaffiliated researchers may access IPD and, when applicable, the linking of the IPD record back to the CTG record; and (3) links to associated publications and, when applicable, the linking of the publication record back to the CTG record. Results: 206 CTG study records were included in the analysis. Few records shared supporting documents, with only 4\% of records sharing all 3 document types. 27\% of records indicated they intended to share IPD, with 45\% of these providing sufficient information to request access to the IPD. Only 1 dataset record was located, which linked back to its corresponding CTG record. The majority of CTG records did not have links to publications (61\%), and only 21\% linked out to at least 1 results publication. All publication records linked back to their corresponding CTG records. Conclusion: With only 4\% of records sharing all supporting document types, 12\% sufficient information to access IPD, and 21\% results publications, improvements can be made to the discoverability of research materials in federally funded, COVID-19 CTG records. Sharing these materials on CTG can increase their discoverability, therefore increasing the validity, transparency, and reusability of clinical research. © 2024, Medical Library Association.

	abstract = {The concept of Society 5.0, first introduced by Japan in 2016, has become a widely accepted model for the development of social infrastructures across the world. It is a model which is expected to take root globally over the next few years. It is also a model which has smart cities, which are connected and inclusive, at its core. The role of open data is critical to smart cities, and the ability to design and implement strategies for its use is a crucial element in their growth and success. This requires a leadership and organisational culture that embraces the concept of open government data (OGD) and understands its key role in the development of smart cities. In this paper, we examine how the leadership and organisational culture in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Countries has impacted the progress of OGD initiatives and, therefore, the transition to smart cities. This is approached via a re-analysis of data from an earlier study in which semi-structured interviews were used to understand the views and attitudes of a range of senior government department personnel in OGD-related roles, where here a new thematic analysis seeks to identify clearer pointers to attitudes and practices directly relating to smart cities and Society 5.0. The focus on internal factors, such as leadership attitudes and organisational culture, as opposed to external factors, such as technology and resources, differentiates this research from previous studies and adds to our current knowledge. The findings lead to a discussion that identifies a likely gap in the leadership provided by more senior figures. A pilot study of a group of these leaders suggests a generalised problem with communication of policy, objectives and strategies, which is crucial to overcoming cultural impediments to smart city development. While further research is required, a need clearly emerges for significant changes in attitude and application at senior managerial and leadership levels if strategic goals are to be achieved. The paper also makes a number of specific recommendations for activities that could improve progress and indicate areas where more research would be beneficial. © 2023 by the authors.},

From this perspective, the paper argues that the public data trust model of data governance and the Responsible Research and Innovation approach offer two powerful tools for public sector data governance. In this context, this paper contributes to the debate about new data governance models and discusses tools and frameworks enabling the use of data for the common good.

The principle of stimulating innovations is enshrined in the legislation governing public procurement. However, the complexity of testing products for innovation criteria, the differences in classifying products as innovative and the specifics of conceptual and categorical framework in this sphere indicate the peculiarities of the implementation of the principle of stimulating innovation by contracting authorities regulated by 44-FL and by 223-FL. This research empirically answers the following questions: What procured products in the market are considered innovative by contracting authorities? What characteristics and peculiarities are specific to innovative public procurement in Russia? What types and categories of contracting authorities perform such procurement? We reveal that the procurement of innovations is related to the law under which the organization conducts purchases, as well as to the organizational and legal form of the contracting authority. The procurement of innovations is also influenced by the method of determining the supplier, the price of the product and the subject of the purchase. The results of the study show heterogeneity in the procurement of innovations by Russian contracting authorities and link this heterogeneity with the differences in the procurement legislation. © HSE, 2024.},

A proof of concept was implemented by using modern techniques and technologies, with a pilot conducted among selected SMEs and government employees to test the approach’s viability. Findings: The findings identify current OD platforms generally, and in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, they encounter several difficulties, including that the data sets are complex to understand and determine their potential for reuse. The application of big data analytics in mitigating the identified challenges is demonstrated through the artefacts that have been developed. Research limitations/implications: This paper discusses several challenges that must be addressed to ensure that OD is accessible, helpful and of high quality in the future when planning and implementing OD initiatives. Practical implications: The proposed ODP+ integrates social network data, SME data sets and government databases. It will give SMEs a platform for combining data from government agencies, third parties and social networks to carry out complex analytical scenarios or build the needed application using artificial intelligence. Social implications: The findings promote the potential future utilisation of OD and suggest ways to give users access to knowledge and features.

As the increase in the volume of available data, machine processing was one of two essential requirements to promote interoperability, thus allowing the effective reuse of open government data. This data article aims to reveal the data collection process in the IBGE aggregate data API, which makes available aggregate data from surveys and censuses carried out in Brazil. Method: This research is characterized as descriptive and exploratory, with a qualitative, and applied approach because it involves a practical problem that collects two data in the IBGE aggregate data API. For this reason, a documentary search was carried out to identify the broken points (endpoints) available and the parameters existing in the API, which will allow the implementation of “filters” to recover data and relevant information in a universe with many sets of aggregated data. Reuse potential: The availability of two sets of IBGE research data, in an automated manner, allows them to be monitored, recovered and used in the direction and maintenance of public policies, contributing to the identification of patterns, behaviors and habits of the population, by various segments of civil society, including companies (public and private), promoting new digital business models that use data and information from different contexts, creating new products, services and occupations. © 2023, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

	abstract = {The demand for open data has led to the creation and the availability of numerous portals releasing data. However, a large percentage of them are not properly designed for professional use. One way to analyze the value that a portal delivers is through its reputation, but this is a concept that has not yet been well defined or measured. This work will focus its attention on the reputation of open data portals with two objectives. The first objective is to delimit the concept of reputation for open data portals, therefore leading to the first proposed research question: How can the reputation of open data portals be defined? The second objective is to propose criteria for measuring reputation and to create a reputation index for open data portals, with the second research question: How can the reputation of open data portals be assessed? This work is conceptual and descriptive and proposes a multidimensional definition of this concept, which includes whether it is known, being known for something, and its generalized favorability. In addition, a proposal is made for a reputation index identifying its dimensions and measurements, and finally, an analysis of its usefulness is presen-ted. To this end, a figure has been created that summarizes the dimensions and benefits for creators and developers of open data portals and for the different application sectors (public, private, academic, and third sector). This research can help public administrations and other sectors to have a reference of good practices when offering open data to citizens and organizations oriented toward creating value in society. © 2023, El Profesional de la Informacion.

	abstract = {Solid waste management is a pressing global issue, aligning with Sustainable Development Goals 11 and 12. Despite increasing awareness, the annual rise in waste generation is expected to persist for decades. Efficient waste management is crucial for channeling valuable resources into circular economy flows while safeguarding health and the environment. While best practices are informative, localized actions tailored to specific contexts are essential. This study proposes a thematic framework, grounded in techno-policy, to prioritize actions for achieving sustainable solid waste management (SSWM) in Qatar, with potential applicability to other countries. The prioritized recommendations include enhancing research and policy coordination, harnessing value from waste, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and promoting awareness campaigns. The study underscores the significance of private sector training, plastic recycling, and addressing the impact of mega-events on waste management. It identifies key stakeholders, such as researchers, businesses, government, and the community, emphasizing their roles in implementing effective waste management strategies. Challenges, however, arise from the absence of comprehensive and up-to-date open data, hindering a full understanding of recent developments and identification of priority areas for future research. In summary, this study introduces a novel techno-policy-driven framework for prioritizing SSWM actions, emphasizing the need for targeted efforts in diverse contexts to address the escalating global waste challenge. © 2024},

	abstract = {Today, the concepts of the smart city and smart government are well established, and have become key in dealing with the challenges faced by rapidly increasing urbanisation across the world. One of the many ways in which smart cities and government can help meet these challenges is by empowering citizens to take more and better control of their own decisions, by giving them access to open (i.e., public and unrestricted) data via online portals. These portals can enable citizens and professionals to make more informed decisions across a wide variety of areas, from health and traffic issues to developing new businesses. They can also encourage citizens to become more involved in the making of more effective social policy. Open data is increasingly seen as a key enabler in designing and implementing knowledge-based solutions for more sustainable urban development. For these reasons, as well as others, OGD (Open Government Data) portals are already being implemented in many countries. However, if smart cities are to maximise their potential, OGD portals must be understood, accepted and—crucially—used by the public. The extent to which this is the case is not clear, as there have been few studies that have specifically examined the impact of open data in a smart city context. This is particularly true in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries. This research uses a mixed methods (questionnaires and interviews) approach to examine this issue by carrying out a comparative study of the use of portals across the region and, therefore, whether these countries are making optimum use of open data. An existing evaluation framework was used with a group of evaluators representing professional users who are not experienced in using data portals. The findings of the research suggest that these countries are not yet realising the full potential of their portals, and more effective support for the transition to smart cities could be achieved with fuller and better cross-national cooperation. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Currently, the military actions on the territory of Ukraine require significant support from EU countries and partners in providing military and material assistance. The issue of openness and transparency of budgeting, particularly in the defence and security sector, becomes even more significant. The peak of interest in the literature on the issues of openness and transparency of budgeting appeared in 2005–2006. However, in Ukraine, which has largely continued to follow Soviet trends, this is an alarming subject. It has been brought to the forefront by the events after the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. One of the ways to guarantee the openness and transparency of budgeting is the development of a suitable open data system, which includes the analysis of all financial costs based on the proper methodology. Such a methodology should be founded on the concept of assessing the openness and transparency of budgeting and financial management of the defence and security sector of Ukraine at the current stage in the conditions of war and, after it, be measured quantitatively and implemented using IT. This article aims to consider the methodology of an index of openness and transparency of budgeting and financial management of the defence and security sector and to implement it in the case of Ukraine. Based on the conducted literature review, a new method to calculate the index of openness and budgeting transparency of the defence and security sector of Ukraine is built. Nine separate indicators are defined, and each of them affects the final value of the index. Some indicators have a binary form, and some have a scale, which is used to estimate their specific weight of impact. This approach makes it possible not only to monitor the openness and transparency of the defence and security sector but also to show the dynamics of the development of the phenomenon and compare it, in the future, with other countries. Based on calculations for 2008–2021, the trend of this index is shown for Ukraine, and conclusions are made regarding its further application. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The public sector publishes vast amounts of open data and metadata. APIs (application programming interfaces) are transforming the way data are collected, documented, and disseminated. The transformation is slow, however, due to differences in communication protocol, data definition, and data format. The development is of particular relevance to demography, being a data-intensive science. It paves the way to the automation of data acquisition and the integration of data acquisition and data analysis. Together with the parallel development of literate programming, which allows the integration of text and computer code in a single document, programmatic access to data makes workflows transparent, verifiable, and easy to replicate by others. The Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX) standard, which has emerged as a popular option for data and metadata exchange, makes finding and retrieving data and metadata easy and swift. Query strings form URLs with a standardised syntax. OBJECTIVE The aim of this paper is to describe the SDMX standard and demonstrate its benefits to our profession by retrieving demographic data and the associated metadata from online databases disseminated by a variety of data providers. The software environment used is R. CONTRIBUTION This is the first review of the SDMX standard aimed at the study of population. The paper includes the R code to access databases and download data and metadata. The paper includes several hyperlinks to relevant documents issued by data providers, giving readers immediate access to the referenced material. © 2023 Frans Willekens.},

While some governments are actively adapting to these trends, others remain behind, despite the pressure. This research explores the political and administrative reasons behind these differences. By analyzing how local governments in South Korea handled requests for open data from citizens between 2007 and 2016, the study highlights the importance of political competition and administrative strength in fostering government transparency and effectively addressing citizen data requests. The study assesses open government data based on its scope, time, and quality, finding that higher levels of electoral competition and better administrative capabilities contribute to increased transparency and responsiveness. However, the study's use of a regression discontinuity design reveals that the political party controlling local governments had minimal influence on these factors.

	abstract = {During the last decade, a new approach to bureaucratic reform in the field of public administration, open government, has aimed to increase government transparency and accountability and improve participation of citizens and other stakeholders of government. In the current era of digital governance transformations, evaluating governmental efforts to become open is a central concern of politicians, policymakers, and researchers. Various global maturity models have been developed, but the majority of them focus on the technological capacities of government rather than the historic affinity of openness and democratic governance. In this study, we attempt to address this problem by conceptualizing how governments harness technology innovations and by prescribing developmental phases for open government. Using the qualitative meta-synthesis method, we compare 10 open government maturity models to find the similarities and differences between them. Finally, we present a comprehensive model which evaluates the open government initiatives holistically and includes the following six major stages: (1) an initial stage; (2) a transparency and accountability stage; (3) an open collaboration stage; (4) a platform stage; (5) a democratic open government stage; and, finally, (6) an open governance stage. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Peer-reviewed articles were identified and analysed from major bibliographic databases, including Web of Science, Digital ACM Library, IEEE Explore Digital Library, and Science Direct. Included articles focus on identifying individual information privacy concerns from the viewpoint of OGD stakeholders or providing solutions for mitigating concerns and risks. Papers that discussed and focused on general privacy issues or privacy concerns of open data in general or open science privacy concerns were excluded. Three streams of research were identified: 1) exploring privacy concerns and balance with OGD value propositions, 2) proposing solutions for mitigating privacy concerns, and 3) developing risk-based frameworks for the OGD program at different governmental levels. Findings suggest that contradictions with Fair Information Practices, reidentification risks, conflicts with OGD value propositions, and smart city data practices are significant privacy concerns in the literature. Proposed solutions include technical, legal, and procedural measures to mitigate privacy concerns.

Due to this, most Global North countries have advanced in the deployment of e-government for improving public-service delivery. Unfortunately, most African countries, including Ghana, are still lagging in e-government development. This study examined e-government development across African Union member states. It explored the role of e-government in the reform of public administration and governance, focusing on Ghana as a case study. Using a mixed-method approach, the study analyzed secondary data of key e-government indicators using the TOPSIS method. This helped underscore the transformative impact on public administration and governance by using primary data via interviews. The results show advanced progress in some African countries, including Ghana, due to aligned digital strategies with national policies. Also, technology integration is evident in Ghana’s public sector and is reshaping public administration and governance. The study recommends that to achieve the long-term sustainability of these advancements, interagency collaboration and data-sharing mechanisms between the public and private sectors should be strengthened, while all forms of silos should be broken to promote the delivery of services. This study enhances public-service delivery by identifying areas needing both improvement and allocation of resources for shaping e-government policy development. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Among the priority concerns that figure in the public manager’s portfolio, the existing problems in cities when planning a more efficient management of urban space are well known. Within the wide range of reflections that local corporations consider, one of their main concerns is based on achieving a more livable city model, where the quality of life of its inhabitants is substantially improved and founded on sustainable development parameters. In view of these considerations, the purpose of this research is to establish an analysis of the formal relationship between urban sustainability and spatial morphology in a medium-sized Spanish city chosen as a pattern. The methodological process established combines the application of open data (from public administrations) with the calculation of urban sustainability indicators and GIS tools, with a particular focus at the neighborhood level. The results obtained at a global level throughout the city show that a large number of indicators including density, green areas, public facilities, public parking and cultural heritage elements are above the minimum standards required, which means that they comfortably meet the regulatory requirements and presumably present an adequate degree of sustainability. On the other hand, other indicators such as building compactness, urban land sponging and organic and recycling bins are below the minimum required standard. Considering the evaluation of the urban model obtained and, through the urban planning instruments set out in the law, the necessary corrective measures must be established to try to adapt the urban configuration to the objectives of sustainable development. It can be concluded that the implementation of urban sustainability indicators as a territorial planning tool linked to GIS tools would objectively facilitate the application of measures to promote the improvement of the citizens’ quality of life. However, the availability of open data sources must be taken into account as a prerequisite to develop the transformation into useful parameters for their practical application for citizens in urban environments. © 2023 by the authors.},

Through the data investigation and analysis of 55 countries, this research finds that the development of open government data is positively linked with national culture with respect to individualism, indulgence and long-term orientation and is negatively related to power distance. Furthermore, this study shows that economic development moderates the relationship between national culture and open government data development, especially with respect to individualism and long-term orientation. Practically, the findings of this research can help policymakers better understand the multifaceted impacts of national culture on the development of open government data, including the promotion of cultural values (i.e. high individualism, high indulgence, and high long-term orientation) and the change in the passive and conservative attitude of citizens toward the openness of government data in countries where power distance culture is high. © The Author(s) 2023.},

For this reason, errors in address data can affect the geographic location of events, map representations, and spatial analyses. Thus, this paper presents the development of an algorithm for evaluating the quality of semantic and geographic information in any geospatial address dataset. The reference datasets are accessible using open data platforms or spatial data infrastructure (SDI) and volunteered geographic information (VGI), and both have been compared with commercial datasets using geocoding web services. Address quality analysis was developed using several open-source data science code libraries combined with spatial databases and geographic information systems. In addition, the quality of geographic addresses was evaluated by carrying out normalized tests in accordance with International Geospatial Standards (ISO 19157). Finally, this methodology assesses the quality of authorized and VGI address datasets that can be used for geocoding any relevant information in specific urban areas. © 2023 by the authors.},

Our approach consists in triangulating the analysis of in-depth interviews with representatives of the local administrations with documents obtained from the cities. The interviews investigated the experiences and perspectives of local administrations regarding establishing a local or regional data ecosystem. The article examines experiences and obstacles to data sharing within seven administrations investigating what currently prevents the establishment of data ecosystems. The findings are summarized along three main lines. First, the limited involvement of private sector organizations as actors in local data ecosystems through emerging forms of data sharing. Second, the concern over technological aspects and the lack of attention on social or organizational issues. Third, a conceptual decision to apply a centralized and not a federated digital infrastructure. © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.},

The analysis of publication records can provide a wealth of information about scientific collaboration, including the number of publications, the impact of the publications, and the areas of research where collaborations are most common. By providing detailed information on the patterns and trends in scientific collaboration, these tools can help to inform policy decisions and promote the development of effective strategies to support and enhance scientific collaborations between countries. This study aimed to analyze and visualize the scientific collaboration between Japan and Russia, using bibliometric analysis of collaborative publications from the Web of Science (WoS) database. The analysis utilized the bibliometrix package within the R statistical program. The analysis covered a period of two decades, from 2000 to 2021. The results showed a slight decrease in co-authored publications, with an annual growth rate of −1.26\%. The keywords and thematic trends analysis confirmed that physics is the most co-authored field between the two countries. The study also analyzed the collaboration network and research funding sources. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the current state of scientific collaboration between Japan and Russia. The study also highlights the importance of research funding sources in promoting and sustaining scientific cooperation between countries. The analysis suggests that more efforts in government funding are needed to increase collaboration between the two countries in various fields. © 2024 by author(s).},

	abstract = {There are now an estimated 114 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, some 88\% of whom are in low- and middle-income countries. For governments and international organizations to design effective policies and responses, they require comparable and accessible socioeconomic data on those affected by forced displacement, including host communities. Such data is required to understand needs, as well as interactions between complex drivers of displacement and barriers to durable solutions. However, high-quality data of this kind takes time to collect and is costly. Can the ever-increasing volume of open data and evolving innovative techniques accelerate and enhance its generation? Are there applications of alternative data sources, advanced statistics, and machine-learning that could be adapted for forced displacement settings, considering their specific legal and ethical dimensions? As a catalytic bridge between the World Bank and UNHCR, the Joint Data Center on Forced Displacement convened a workshop to answer these questions. This paper summarizes the emergent messages from the workshop and recommendations for future areas of focus and ways forward for the community of practice on socioeconomic data on forced displacement. Three recommended areas of future focus are: enhancing and optimizing household survey sampling approaches; estimating forced displacement socioeconomic indicators from alternative data sources; and amplifying data accessibility and discoverability. Three key features of the recommended approach are: strong complementarity with the existing data-collection-to-use-pipeline; data responsibility built-in and tailored to forced displacement contexts; and iterative assessment of operational relevance to ensure continuous focus on improving outcomes for those affected by forced displacement. © The Author(s), 2023.

A multi-layered model of “open data - data utilization - data value creation”, aiming to reveal the synergistic evolution mechanisms between the three levels was proposed. The results show that: (1) From 2012 to 2021, a synergistic evolution mechanism occurs between the data-opening layer and the value-creating layer, with value generation as the order parameter. (2) From 2022 to 2035, there may be a shift in the dominance of the order parameter between the data-opening layer and the value-creating layer, and a new synergistic evolution mechanism between the data-opening layer and the data-utilizing layer might be generated.

Despite the importance of the government analytics workforce in driving academic-based data sharing and linkage platforms, little is known about how public sector managers assess capacity in health analytics. This case study describes findings from consultations among middle managers of analytics services in a Canadian provincial health ministry. Methods Data collection involved a mixed-questions survey to gauge the functional perspective of managers on organisational and human resource analytics capacity within the New Brunswick Department of Health. The repeated cross-sectional survey was implemented in two rounds, with a baseline collected before the Covid-19 global outbreak (in 2016) and a follow-up after the pandemic emergency response (in 2022). Results The post-pandemic period was associated with perceptions of a growing role for public service personnel in handling analytics. Recruitment and retention of skilled analytics professionals emerged as the top priority for capacity building, including needs-based planning, competitive compensation packages to address skills shortages, professional development and promotion opportunities, and tracking key performance indicators for employee satisfaction. Conclusions Government health analytics professionals play a critical role in advancing administrative data use and re-use. Enhanced knowledge sharing is needed on best practices in supply-demand monitoring for analytics professionals and planning for human resources surge capacity in the public service, lest significant innovation potential for health system improvement be left untapped. 2024 © The Authors.},

	abstract = {Administrative geography is concerned with the hierarchy of areas related to national and local government in a country. They form an important dataset in the country’s open data provision and act as the geo-referencing backdrop for many types of geospatial data. Proprietary ontologies are built to model and represent these data with little focus on spatial semantics. Studying the quality of these ontologies and developing methods for their evaluation are needed. This paper addresses these problems by studying the spatial semantics of administrative geography data and proposes a uniform set of qualitative semantics that encapsulates the inherent spatial structure of the administrative divisions and allows for the application of spatial reasoning. Topological and proximity semantics are defined and combined into a single measure of spatial completeness and used for defining a set of competency questions to be used in the evaluation process. The significance of the novel measure of completeness and competency questions is demonstrated on four prominent real world administrative geography ontologies. It is shown how these can provide an objective measure of quality of the geospatial ontologies and gaps in their definition. The proposed approach to defining spatial completeness complements the established methods in the literature, that primarily focus on the syntactical and structural dimensions of the ontologies, and offers a novel approach to ontology evaluation in the geospatial domain. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Only 18\% of global flood losses experienced between 2011 and 2021 were insured. Governments are increasingly examining ways to transfer financial flood risks to the private insurance market. Flood insurance is widely recognized as an effective financial risk-transfer mechanism that helps societies efficiently recover from sudden and unexpected flood losses. However, flood insurance is often unavailable to high-risk properties via the private market. Insurers assert that access to better flood model data and sustained investment in flood damage prevention can foster flood insurance availability and affordability as risks can be more precisely evaluated and fewer damages result from flooding. This paper presents a conceptual framework for a data platform designed to reduce and manage the number of high-risk uninsurable properties through public-private data-sharing. Drawing on survey results from municipalities and insurance companies, it assesses whether the conceptual data platform has a role to play in Canada. The study entailed participation of municipal officials representing 59 Canadian cities, and insurance professionals representing 7 insurance companies. Findings confirm there is appetite for both sectors to engage in cross-sector data-sharing and that the conceptual data platform is perceived as a tool that could establish new forms of collaboration that can lead to changes in flood insurance availability in high-risk areas. Other countries experiencing insurance challenges with high-risk properties could benefit from testing the viability of the conceptual data platform in their context. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Around 2009–2010, opening up public data was a governmental strategy in the UK, as part of the implementation of the Transparency Agenda, based on the assumption that unfettered access to government data would inexorably lead to transparency, accountability and participation. Following this conjecture, and in an attempt to create an alternative to the corporate-driven smart city discourse, the Greater London Authority prioritised open data in its initial smart city plans to facilitate a ‘citizen-centred’ smart city. However, subsumed within the digital economy, open data was eventually promoted and implemented primarily for its lucrative potential to create new businesses, rather than prioritising the aspirations of transparency and participation. In this article, I explore the implications of this shift and the nature of open data- driven smart city making by focusing on a transport app, Citymapper that is built on open data released by Transport for London (TfL). By closely studying the app's product development process to generate profit together with its struggle to raise funding through venture capital and crowdfunding, I arrive at two main arguments. First, I argue that open data driven smart city making in London was a form of experimentation instead of a formal and rigid planning as it saw open data as an end in itself without much understanding of what this process would lead to in practice. As such, the case of Citymapper shows that the contingent process of opening up public transport data meant opening up public infrastructure in the city. Second, by examining the app's unsustainable business models and detailing its struggle to maintain revenue and profitability, I outline how open data-driven products are ultimately subsumed within the logic of platform capitalism rather than creating an alternative digital economy. © 2024},

To ensure that OGD can be used effectively in future crises, there is a need to understand how it may be used and what benefits its usage may bring. This paper brings new insight into this topic by conducting a comparative exploratory case study of three Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries - Czech Republic, Estonia and Latvia, where OGD was used at different levels to help manage different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of this research, three contributions are made: (1) it integrates OGD into previous crisis management literature, offering new and initial conceptual propositions; (2) it demonstrates how OGD enables the co-creation of new services that create public value during times of crisis; and (3) it provides empirical examples of OGD-driven co-created services. © 2023 - IOS Press.

In this article we investigate four countries/regions — Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union — that have banned or attempted to govern TikTok, examining the policy and legal bases for such restrictions. Our analysis is conceptually informed by legal and political narrations of foreign interference and technological sovereignty. We approach this with particular attention to countries with existing intelligence and data sharing agreements (i.e. three members of the Five Eyes alliance and the trilateral AUKUS alliance) and the European Union given its regulatory approach to data protection. This research makes significant and timely contributions to the geopolitics of TikTok and foreign interference in an international context. It informs inconsistencies in regulatory and legal approaches relating to foreign interference and data sovereignty, beyond “China threat” narratives. We argue that the European Union regulation presents an approach that attempts to protect citizens and citizen data rather than attack platforms and governments that challenge Western technological hegemony. © 2024, Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society.

The prevailing strategy to building OGD platform ecosystems follows a sequential approach where the OGD platform is built first and the ecosystem is built second, resulting in low engagement. In this paper, we derive insights into an alternative approach to developing OGD platform ecosystems from TourismData, a state-owned tourism initiative in Germany. We report on the phases between 2018 and 2022 and derive four dynamic and incremental phases from which we derive three learnings: context specificity, continuous adaptation, and organic expansion. Our findings have theoretical and practical implications for developing high-engagement OGD platform ecosystems that include and engage ecosystem actors from the start and, hence, take advantage of the generative potential of OGD. This approach illustrates the importance of developing OGD platform ecosystems with high contextual relevance to ensure that data can be used to enable meaningful interactions between ecosystem actors and promote continuous adaptation and expansion. © 2023 The Authors},

However, OGD has hardly any value on its own, yet the value is created by its use, hence supporting OGD portal use is a key point to delivering public value. Indeed, making an effective impact on OGD requires users to activate its value. Therefore, this study aims to propose a model to explore factors that hinder or facilitate public value creation using OGD from the public sector employee perspective. Using the DeLone and McLean (2003) model as a theoretical basis with the combination of the Moore (1995) framework, the study model was validated in the Australian public sector, using partial least square structural equation modelling. The results of this study support the validity of the research model and discover the factors that have a significant influence on public value creation through the use of OGD in the Australian public sector. Findings reveal that employee's OGD portal use and their satisfaction significantly predict the public value of OGD, while the OGD portal quality, open data quality and service support indirectly affect the public value of OGD. Furthermore, the moderator analysis suggests that awareness of the value of OGD among public sector employees has a critical effect on the delivery of public value. The proposed theoretical framework can be used to assess the factors affecting OGD public value creation by users in the public sector, which can help researchers and developers to improve and update their system, based on the results. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Mobility as a service (MaaS) is an emerging framework that integrates multiple transport services into a single and intuitive platform. This paper contrasts the urban passenger transport markets in developed versus developing economies to understand the challenges of integrating mobility services using the MaaS framework, with a focus on decarbonization and sustainability as societal goals. In addition, we conducted a Life Cycle Assessment of carbon emissions and energy requirements of travel alternatives in the city of Santiago, Chile, to shed light on the effects of multimodality as an environmental tool. A summary of findings follows. Data sharing and open data are new in developing countries, and thus more investment in data infrastructure is required so that MaaS can leverage digital technology and network optimization. If the scalability of MaaS is an open question in developed countries, it is more so in developing countries, owning to institutional and financial constraints that are present in the latter. The lack of public subsidies to support formal public transport is a key limitation for the implementation of MaaS schemes and multimodal frameworks in the developing world. Regarding formality, in countries with an informal public transport sector, a potential implementation of MaaS will be spatially constrained to those locations where public transport operates formally and frequently (BRT and rail lines), limiting its spatial coverage and posing social equity issues. In countries with scarce or no public funds available for the transport sector, MaaS could be used as a catalyst for a broad environmental and equity-seeking transport pricing reform which requires a direct involvement of public sector in both regulation and financial backing. We conclude that the formalization and general improvement of the public transport sector, the regulation of shared-mobility platforms including the formalization of the work of drivers, and the setting of proper pricing and subsidization instruments in the direction of internalizing the social costs of motorized traffic, are all prerequisites for any MaaS system that aims to improve economic efficiency, social equity, and sustainability. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The complex societal problems that we face today require unprecedented collaboration and evidence-based decisions. These collaboration processes are further propelled by the datafication of virtually all spheres of public life. To benefit from this, the data needs to be made available to allow for data analytics. Thus, data sharing becomes a crucial aspect of cross-sector collaborations that aim to create and capture value from information. Compared to collaborations where data sharing is not the main goal, data sharing partnerships face a number of novel challenges, such as mitigating data risks, complying with data protection legislation, and ensuring responsible data use. Navigating these waters and achieving data sharing can be challenging for both governments and businesses, as well as other actors. How do organizations from different sectors manage to achieve data sharing for addressing societal challenges? To address this research question, we apply a framework of three models of cross sector social partnerships developed in the field of organization studies to structure the analysis of six cases. Our analysis suggests that to a certain extent the partnership model determines the types of drivers and challenges to sharing data in a partnership. Leveraging the drivers and anticipating these challenges can help organizations be more aware of key terms of the collaboration and the mechanisms that can be used to succeed in their partnership goals. © 2023 The Authors},

In reality, however, the Chinese government’s efforts at the building of a digital society are permeated by confusion over the meaning of central edicts, interdepartmental and regional fragmentation, and overlap between different digital governance systems. This article interrogates the connection between two emerging governance infrastructures embedded in the Chinese Party-state’s latest informatization drive, the “National Civilized Cities Award” (NCCA) and the “Social Credit System Project” (SCSP) through a mixed methods approach. It combines data from an analysis of a recent NCCA assessment system government work manual, project websites, and findings from thirty qualitative video interviews with residents from twenty different cities in China to demonstrate that overlap between these projects is clear in terms of 1) criteria and indices measuring project development; 2) promoted virtues and individual behaviors; and 3) data sharing between systems. Local governments charged with the design and implementation of these initiatives frequently conflate their targets and objectives, prompting occasional reprimand from higher-level authorities. Public confusion about the meaning and purpose of both the NCCA and SCSP has meanwhile accompanied haphazard system development, demonstrating that the path towards a “digital society” in China is fraught and far from uncontested. © The Author(s) 2023.},

Though irrationality and biases may play some role, there may be other explanations for these decisions. By building on Hirschman's Hiding Hand and Flyvbjerg's concept of megaproject sublimes, and drawing upon institutional theory, this conceptual article advances the hypothesis that formal cost-benefit analysis is inherently bounded, and may fail to account for diffuse benefits that may support the commencement of public projects. Flyvbjerg's megaproject sublimes are used to construct a framework of such benefits, and proposed methods to test and substantiate them.

	abstract = {Intergovernmental collaboration is needed to address global problems. Modern solutions to these problems often include data-driven methods like artificial intelligence (AI), which require large amounts of data to perform well. As AI emerges as a central catalyst in deriving effective solutions for global problems, the infrastructure that supports its data needs becomes crucial. However, data sharing between governments is often constrained due to socio-technical barriers such as concerns over data privacy, data sovereignty issues, and the risks of information misuse. Federated learning (FL) presents a promising solution as a decentralized AI methodology, enabling the use of data from multiple silos without necessitating central aggregation. Instead of sharing raw data, governments can build their own models and just share the model parameters with a central server aggregating all parameters, resulting in a superior overall model. By conducting a structured literature review, we show how major intergovernmental data-sharing challenges listed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development can be overcome by utilizing FL. Furthermore, we provide a tangible resource implementing FL linked to the Ukrainian refugee crisis that can be utilized by researchers and policymakers alike who want to implement FL in cases where data cannot be shared. Enhanced AI while maintaining privacy through FL thus allows governments to collaboratively address global problems, positively impacting governments and citizens. © The Author(s), 2024.

Public data service is crucial starting point for realising this goal. However, practical challenges persist in public data service, including unclear processes and insufficient identification of public data service citizens’ information needs. Method \& Analysis. We employed an inductive methodology to analyse the public data service users’ information needs and annual distribution among information needs. Based on a data-driven approach, we mapped these information needs sub-categories into four main procedures in public data service. This paper further identified the hierarchy of information needs based on public data processing levels. We utilised Sankey diagram to effectively illustrate cross-analysis result between topics and information needs’ subcategories. Results. The typical levels of public data service users’ information needs include informing, utilisation, problem-solving, social life service, and society governance. Furthermore, our study reveals the data flow among sub-categories of public data service information needs follows the logic of Datafication-Government to Government-Government to citizens-Data to Optimiation. Conclusion. Government departments should ensure public data quality and facilitate efficient data circulation processes. We recommend understanding relationships between public data resources and services derived from them through a problem-solving lens. Our findings will serve as a reference tool for analysing information needs of public data service users in other countries. © 2024, University of Boras. All rights reserved.},

Based on an exploratory approach this paper adopted the structured search and evaluation method to investigate and evaluate the dashboards portals. This paper concludes that data are shown in different formats in all countries and with different functionalities and thus can help people follow the evolution of the disease and also the policy decision.

	abstract = {The 2019 Directive on Open Data and the Re-use of Public Sector Information draws together two traditions in ensuring proactive access to government data. On one hand, it embraces the concept of 'open data', a concept rooted in government accountability and transparency for citizen participation. On the other hand, the directive covers the re-use of non-sensitive public sector information, which is deemed crucial for the internal market and realisation of the European data economy. Indeed, the directive itself is a further iteration of an earlier 2003 directive on the re-use of public sector information. Yet, despite the appearance of a seamless fusion of the different concepts, it is important to interrogate critically to what extent open data is actually incorporated. While the shorthand title for directive the Open Data Directive (ODD), there is a risk that much of the open data movement's demands fall outside of its purview. Hence, the present paper undertakes a careful analysis of the ODD. It asks firstly, how does the directive align with and diverge from the rationale and requirements of the movement for open data? And secondly, what are the implications of this for citizen participation? The findings show that the original largely technical principles of open data are somewhat respected and incorporated into the ODD but are disjointed from the rationale behind them. References to citizen participation in the directive and supporting documentation, while welcome, risk being little more than window dressing. © 2023 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Airbnb and other home-sharing platforms have been facing increasing regulation over the past years, mainly in the form of restricting short-term rentals through day caps. In contrast, as one of the first countries in the world, Denmark applied a collaborative strategy: In 2018, the government negotiated an agreement with Airbnb about the transmission of income data from the platform to the tax agency. We analyze how this data-sharing agreement affected hosts' behavior on the platform, using a difference-in-differences approach with Sweden as a counterfactual. We find that the agreement reduced hosts’ propensity to list property on the platform by 14\%, while increasing listing prices by 11\%. Our results indicate that platform exits were mostly limited to single-property hosts. In contrast, hosts with many properties and those in areas with initially low Airbnb penetration made their rental objects more often available and managed to increase the number of bookings. Overall, the findings imply that the data-sharing agreement not only helped to increase tax compliance but also led to a commercialization and spatial re-organization of short-term renting in Denmark. © 2023 The Authors},

China has been developing rigorous and stringent data governance such as data localization requirements and mandatory business-to-government data sharing, and has also concluded the world's second largest IIA regime that provides sweeping investment protection. There is a risk of incompatibility between China's national data policies and its IIA obligations. Foreign investors may challenge China's national laws and practices on data governance, for alleged breaches of investor's protection obligations in Chinese IIAs, or breaches of the data residency provisions in Chinese trade and investment agreements.

	abstract = {– This study is a systematic review that intends to improve our knowledge of the ideas of open data synchronization and standardization by reviewing the methodology and instruments utilized in previous studies through a careful examination of accessible literature. The methodology of this study was developed in several key phases. Firstly, a search was conducted in electronic databases to identify relevant studies in the field for Open Government Data (OGD). After identifying the studies, they were carefully reviewed through an initial abstract-based screening process. In the next phase, the research design and sample used in each identified study were analyzed to assess their quality and reliability. Subsequently, data from the studies were analyzed and categorized into various categories, including the usability of open data, synchronization, scalability, and reliability. The gained results highlight the importance of open data in our information-driven society. Open data positively impact transparency, anti-corruption efforts, and free access to information. To achieve these benefits, it is crucial to standardize and license open data, giving priority to their usability. The study underscores the importance of open data for transparency, innovation, and citizen engagement. Despite the disadvantages, this technology has the potential to change how governments and society use data. © 2024 Besart Hyseni \& Lejla Abazi Bexheti; published by UIKTEN.

	abstract = {Institutional factors such as data standardization, data interoperability, and the ability to include other stakeholders (e.g., civil society) in ecosystems are now understood as crucial considerations in Open Government Data (OGD) implementation. However, most of the current understanding of institutional factors linked to OGD growth has evolved around highly digitalized and developed countries. This study aims to address this gap by investigating open data implementation in Indonesia, a developing country that has been an early advocate of OGD in the "Asia Pacific". In 2014, Indonesia implemented Satu Data Indonesia (One Data Indonesia) as a national initiative to promote OGD objectives. We employ institutional dimensions as the central theoretical lens to unpack the successes and impediments to Satu Data Indonesia’s development. This research dataset is built on 16 expert interviews from government (n = 14) and private (n = 2) organizations that directly contribute to the growth of Satu Data Indonesia, qualitatively triangulated with documentary analysis of key policy and regulatory documents. These new data provide important insights into the complexity and challenges of nationwide OGD implementation and data-sharing. Our findings show that despite its being an early advocate, Indonesia’s OGD initiative is still in the early stages of development, impeded by several policy and administrative bottlenecks. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Purpose: 1) Identification and empirical analysis of factual knowledge regarding the behavior of socio-political elites as determinants of policies for welfare in the context of poverty alleviation in the Kanang village community of three Minahasa Regency, 2) Finding a form of selecting the social political elite "Hukum Tua" in Kanonang Tiga village which prioritizes the strength of local wisdom from all levels of society and the role of the social political elite in the people of Kanonang Tiga village, Minahasa Regency through the election of "Hukum Tua" which will later become the determinant of community decision making. Method: Qualitative research uses exploratory methods. Purposive sampling, open data collection, text or image analysis, presentation of information in figures and tables, and individual interpretation of results, provision of information. The data obtained from the sources was collected using a more natural method, namely by conducting interviews and direct observation of the socio-political elites involved in the "Hukum Tua" election in Kanonang Tiga Village. This research can provide factual knowledge and an overview of the role of social and political elites in the social strata of society who can interact and communicate in the "Hukum Tua Election" process . The research sample in Kanonang Tiga Village represents the research area in a sample of villages and environments in the province of North Sulawesi, Indonesia. research material in the form of a vision and mission program from "Hukum Tua" candidates. Results and conclusion: Local wisdom management in the selection of social political elites in Kanonang Tiga village based on Putnam's theory concludes that social political elite groups are homogeneous, very influential, have family or sibling relationships, even though the social political elites have different views. The determination of the victory of the "Hukum Tua" in Kanonang Tiga village is largely determined by social leaders, religious leaders, educational leaders, political party figures in the management of the Kanonang Tiga village area, Minahasa Regency. The influence and power possessed by the social and political elites in Kanonang Tiga village determine the decisions and actions taken by the elites. The social and political elite determines victory and can make important decisions to determine the direction of policy, strategy and political action in accordance with their interests. Although this can result in abuse of power and decision making that may not always benefit society as a whole. Research implications: The social and political elites in Kanonang Tiga village come from limited layers, efforts need to be made to diversify their membership. The involvement of traditional leaders, women's leaders and youth leaders needs to be strengthened in the village head election process to create representation that is more inclusive and reflects the various aspects of Kanonang Tiga Village society. They can bring different perspectives and ensure that the policies produced reflect the needs of the entire Kanonang Tiga Village community. Originality/value: Social and political elite management really determines the policies made in the management of local wisdom of the community in North Sulawesi, especially the study area in Kanang III Village, Minahasa Regency. The poverty alleviation program in every village spread across the North Sulawesi Province is largely determined by the choice of 'Hukum Tua'. "Hukum Tua Elected " which is supported by the majority of social layers of society, is expected to be able to make social decisions in society, including policies to suppress land conversion, policies for planting local cultivated plants, preserving biodiversity, ecological and economic balance in Kanonang Tiga village which is supported by regulations and village regulations. The program for "Hukum Tua" candidates offers poverty alleviation programs, biodiversity conservation, strategic commodities, land conversion restriction programs, agricultural land cultivation, farmer insurance, village regulations, and village-owned enterprises in Kanonang Tiga Village, Minahasa Regency. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

They are an important element of most open data initiatives that have enabled a large amount of government data to be widely available. However, data quantity and quality are not the only aspects that should be considered when publishing data. To improve the reusability of data and to achieve greater impact and benefits from open data, it is important to consider user-oriented aspects of the portal management, discovery, and use of data (e.g., organizing the portal in a user-centric way, providing accurate metadata, using a standardized and open data format, etc.). In this paper, we adopted the metrics proposed by the European Commission to assess compliance of the Croatian Open Data Portal with 10 user-oriented principles that open data portals should implement in terms of sustainability and added value. While the results show the government’s efforts in publishing data, some aspects such as better collaboration with data providers and other data portals, offering different visualization tools, etc. need to be improved to achieve active use and impact. © 2023 by the authors.},

This paper focuses on benchmarking of open data initiatives over the years and attempts to identify patterns observed among European countries that could lead to disparities in the development, growth, and sustainability of open data ecosystems. To do this, we studied benchmarks and indices published over the last years (57 editions of 8 artifacts) and conducted a comparative case study of eight European countries, identifying patterns among them considering different potentially relevant contexts such as e-government, open government data, open data indices and rankings, and others relevant for the country under consideration. Using a Delphi method, we reached a consensus within a panel of experts and validated a final list of 94 patterns, including their frequency of occurrence among studied countries and their effects on the respective countries. Finally, we took a closer look at the developments in identified contexts over the years and defined 21 recommendations for more resilient and sustainable open government data initiatives and ecosystems and future steps in this area. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

This is expected to increase exploration interest, which has continued to decrease, and many oil and gas exploration areas will be returned to the government (up to 100 working areas). The study aimed to examine the utilization of random forest classification for oil and gas exploration in the Central Sumatra Basin based on subsurface and surface data. Subsurface data included gravity data, basement structure maps, seismic interpretation maps (6 variables), and surface data, including Landsat 8 OLI data, SRTM DEM, surface geological maps, drainage pattern maps, and topographical maps (32 variables). The method used in this research is a random forest with sample training in oil- and gas-proven and potential areas (6 classes) and non-oil- and gas-potential areas (5 classes). Based on the Ntree 600 parameter, Mtry k, and node size 2, unexplored oil and gas potential areas were identified, consisting of (1) a very high potential area in the south of the Bengkalis graben; (2) three locations of high potential areas located on the banks of the Kiri trough and close to the Aman and Balam grabens; (3) two locations of medium potential category II located east and northwest of the Bengkalis graben; and (4) a medium potential area category I located east of the Bengkalis graben. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose: As stated in the United Nations Global Assessment Report 2022 Concept Note, decision-makers everywhere need data and statistics that are accurate, timely, sufficiently disaggregated, relevant, accessible and easy to use. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate scalable and replicable methods to advance and integrate the use of earth observation (EO), specifically ongoing efforts within the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Work Programme and the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Work Plan, to support risk-informed decision-making, based on documented national and subnational needs and requirements. Design/methodology/approach: Promotion of open data sharing and geospatial technology solutions at national and subnational scales encourages the accelerated implementation of successful EO applications. These solutions may also be linked to specific Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) 2015–2030 Global Targets that provide trusted answers to risk-oriented decision frameworks, as well as critical synergies between the Sendai Framework and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This paper provides examples of these efforts in the form of platforms and knowledge hubs that leverage latest developments in analysis ready data and support evidence-based DRR measures. Findings: The climate crisis is forcing countries to face unprecedented frequency and severity of disasters. At the same time, there are growing demands to respond to policy at the national and international level. EOs offer insights and intelligence for evidence-based policy development and decision-making to support key aspects of the Sendai Framework. The GEO DRR Working Group and CEOS Working Group Disasters are ideally placed to help national government agencies, particularly national Sendai focal points to learn more about EOs and understand their role in supporting DRR. Originality/value: The unique perspective of EOs provide unrealized value to decision-makers addressing DRR.

National health and social care policies and publications should recognise these inequalities and guide service systems in reducing them. In this paper, we employ a document analysis design to analyse a cross-section of English national health and social care publications to investigate how autistic adults’ intimate lives are represented and prioritised in these publications. Most publications do not adequately and proportionally recognise or prioritise autistic people's intimate lives. They focus on the risks associated with sex and relationships and overlook autism-specific intimacy needs. They prioritise participation in the workforce while renouncing government responsibility for supporting intimate relationships which can reduce loneliness and alienation. We offer recommendations to ensure that health and social care publication processes better recognise intimate lives. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Theoretical Framework: A theoretical approach has been used in this study. Concepts such as Small and Micro Community Enterprise Policies, Policy Networks, Policy Implementation, and Community Enterprise Management Potential have been considered. Method: This qualitative study examined how policy implementation, policy network management, and capacity building can help promote community enterprises in Thailand. Several government agencies and community enterprises were interviewed for the research. While community enterprise promotion policies are widely supported, there are challenges in tailoring them to local contexts and ensuring effective collaboration among stakeholders. Bottom-up and context-sensitive policymaking is needed, as well as stronger interorganizational coordination and data sharing mechanisms. Results and Discussion: The research highlights the importance of tailoring policies to local contexts, fostering collaboration among stakeholders, and addressing capacity building needs in a comprehensive manner to promote the success of community enterprises in Thailand. The findings offer guidance for policymakers and practitioners while also suggesting areas for further research to deepen understanding and inform future interventions. Research Implications: This study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of what it takes to promote community enterprises in Thailand and offers valuable guidance for policymakers and practitioners working to support community-based entrepreneurship. The findings underscore the importance of context-sensitive policies, strong collaboration among stakeholders, and a holistic approach to capacity building. Originality/Value: The study contributes to a nuanced understanding of what shapes community enterprise success in Thailand.

However, there is no systematic survey of existing research to understand the evolution of open government data. Such research can facilitate knowledge transfer within and across domains, and foster learning for countries in the early stages of open government data development. This study quantitively extracted the evolution trajectory of open government data based on the main path analysis method and then analysed the underlying motivations. The results show that open government data research went through four main phases and that the open government data movement has spread towards developing countries and smart cities. Different challenges and issues faced by the researchers in each phase drove the evolution of open government data research. Finally, we discuss future directions of open government data research based on our findings and recent development. There is a tendency to create sustainable open government data and smartness by employing artificial intelligence and creating data marketplaces. Points for practitioners: Open government data efforts have evolved over the years into a global phenomenon. Countries have learned from each other and more and more efforts are focused on innovating with open government data by stimulating co-creation and using other incentives. The way that data are opened should focus on achieving goals like innovation, participation, transparency and accountability.

Thus, patients are exposed to challenges ranging from staying on treatment plans longer than necessary, leaving treatment too early and dying of complications. This paper aims to explore the trends, challenges and opportunities of applying big data analytics (BDA) in precision medicine in other locations around the globe and taking lessons for Ethiopia through a systematic review of 14 peer-reviewed articles from three popular databases. The findings indicate that cancer, epilepsy and systemic diseases altogether are areas currently getting big attention. The challenges are attributed to the nature of health data, failure in collaboration of data sharing, ethical and legal issues, interoperability of systems, poor knowledge skills and culture, and poor infrastructure. In addition to the adoption of modern technologies (new and experimental methods, cloud computing, Internet of Things, social networks, etc.), Ethiopia's government initiative to promote private technological firms could be an opportunity to use BDA in precision medicine in Ethiopia. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Co.},

Open Payments is a dataset published annually by the US Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services that documents the transfers of value from pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers to physicians, prescribing non-physicians, and teaching hospitals. In the article, I show context became a manifold concern as differentially-situated actors engaged in modes of public advocacy and social action around not only what data meant, but also what it meant to make data meaningful. I show how “context” took on multiple meanings as it was brought into relationship with certain concepts (such as “light,” “transparency,” and “interpretation”) and as stakeholders developed arguments for where they believed meaning should originate. In presenting this case, I call for further ethnographic attention to the ways in which meaning-making is enacted in relation to datasets—particularly those datasets intended to hold institutions accountable. I conclude the article meditating on the political significance of attending to various “context cultures” when putting data signification in context, along with the implications for how critical data studies scholars historicize big data epistemologies and rhetoric. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Minimal scholarship exists investigating how companies address human rights risks stemming from government requests for user data. Understanding corporate response processes to government requests is central to advancing human rights research at the intersection of tech company conduct. This becomes even more pressing as emerging technologies gather increasing amounts of data. Scholarship demonstrates that transparency reporting cannot assist in analyzing data sharing practices between the private and the public sectors due to a variety of constraints. Using semi-structured interviews with senior staff at technology companies, this paper presents an empirical analysis of how technology company representatives and external advisors seek to align their processes when responding to government requests for user data.

After performing the relevant econometric analyses and the necessary tests to ensure the reliability and robustness of the results, it was found that factors such as population density, debt, unemployment and fiscal effort have a significant impact on transparency. States with a higher debt burden are more transparent and higher unemployment rates hinder government transparency. Several recommendations are offered to promote government transparency, strengthen accountability and improve the position of states in the ranking of State Transparency Portals. © 2024 The Author(s).

Here we study Menlo as a case of what we call ethics governance in the making, finding that this process examines past controversies and enrols existing networks to connect the everyday practice of ethics with ethics as a form of governance. To create the Menlo Report, authors and funders relied on bricolage work with existing, available resources, which significantly shaped both the report’s contents and impacts. Report authors were motivated by both forward- and backward-looking goals: enabling new data-sharing as well as addressing past controversies and their implications for the field’s body of research. Authors also grappled with uncertainty about which ethical frameworks were appropriate and made the decision to classify much network data as human subjects data. Finally, the Menlo Report authors attempted to enrol multiple existing networks in governance through appeals to local research communities as well as taking steps towards federal rulemaking. The Menlo Report serves as a case study in how to study ethics governance in the making: with attention to resources, adaptation, and bricolage, and with a focus on both the uncertainties the process tries to repair, as well as the new uncertainties the process uncovers, which will become the site of future ethics work. © The Author(s) 2023.},

The COVID-19 pandemic has once again exposed deficiencies in existing global health systems, emergency management, and disease surveillance, and highlighted the importance of developing effective evaluation tools. This article outlines current challenges emerging from infectious disease control from the perspective of global health, elucidated through influenza, malaria, tuberculosis, and neglected tropical diseases. The discordance among government actors and absent data sharing platforms or tools has led to unfulfilled targets in health system resilience and a capacity gap in infectious disease response. The current situation calls for urgent action to tackle these threats of global infectious diseases with joined forces through more in-depth international cooperation and breaking governance barriers from the purview of global health. Overall, a systematic redesign should be considered to enhance the resilience of health systems, which warrants a great need to sustain capacity-building efforts in emergency preparedness and response and raises an emerging concern of data integration in the concept of One Health that aims to address shared health threats at the human-animal-environment interface. © 2023, Wuhan University Global Health Institute.},

Although the literature suggests that OGD data sets’ metadata quality is one of the main factors affecting their use, to the best of our knowledge, no quantitative study provided evidence of this relationship. Considering about 400,000 data sets of 28 national, municipal and international OGD portals, we have programmatically analysed their usage, their metadata quality and the relationship between the two. Our analysis has highlighted three main findings. First, regardless of their size, the software platform adopted, and their administrative and territorial coverage, most OGD data sets are underutilised. Second, OGD portals pay varying attention to the quality of their data sets’ metadata. Third, we did not find clear evidence that data sets’ usage is positively correlated to better metadata publishing practices. Finally, we have considered other factors, such as data sets’ category, and some demographic characteristics of the OGD portals, and analysed their relationship with data sets’ usage, obtaining partially affirmative answers. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 1,092 respondents, this study uses partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and polynomial regression with response surface analysis to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of individual and binary institutional dimensions on scientific research innovation. Findings: The findings demonstrate that instructional, structural and restricted access data have a positive effect on scientific research innovation in the individual effect. While the binary effect of institutional dimensions produces varying degrees of scientific research innovation. Furthermore, this study discovers that the perceived usefulness and data capability of researchers differ in the mediating effect of institutional dimensions on scientific research innovation. Originality/value: Theoretically, this study contributes new knowledge on the causal links between data publication institutions and innovation. Practically, the research findings offer government data managers timely suggestions on how to build up institutions to foster greater data usage. © 2024, Rui Mu and Xiaxia Zhao.},

	abstract = {Public value creation is traditionally considered as the citizens' collective expectations with respect to government and public services. Recent e-government literature indicates that what exactly constitutes public value in digital government is still debated. Whereas previous research acknowledges aspects such as co-production and the orchestration role of government in the context of public value creation, there is only a limited understanding of how public value is created by the interactions between government and business actors, and the role digital technologies play in that process. Furthermore, so far, research into public value creation processes is limited to specific services that aim to meet a specific goal; for a more complete view, an integrative perspective is required to address the multiplicity of goals. Societal challenges including climate change, sustainability, and the transition towards circularity will require governments to play a crucial role. Businesses are also transforming their vision by adding societal goals to their economic objectives and contributing to these societal challenges. This necessitates even more the need to explicitly consider the role of business in public value creation processes. In this paper we argue that there is a need to understand public value creation as an interactive process, involving both government and business actors. In this process, voluntary information sharing enabled by digital infrastructures has the potential to contribute to the value creation processes, but the increased complexity of digital technologies obscures the effects they can have on value creation. Therefore, we develop a framework that allows to reason about public value creation as an interactive process, involving government and businesses, facilitated by voluntary information sharing. The framework also allows to reason about how the technological design choices of the underlying digital infrastructure influence this value creation process. For the framework development, we use an in-depth case study from the domain of international trade. We analyze the interactions between customs authorities and supply chain actors for jointly creating public value related to revenue collection, as well as safety and security of goods entering the European Union, using business data made available via a global blockchain-enabled infrastructure. In future research, the framework that we developed can be used to analyze more complex cases with additional public value aspects, such as sustainability and circularity. © 2022 The Authors},

Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative framework, supported by extant literature, is adopted to assess the metadata quality of the six OGD portals of the GCC constituents. Findings: Among the six GCC countries, QA has the most advanced OGD metadata quality followed by KSA, UAE, OM, BH and KW. Furthermore, the OGD metadata quality (MQ) of UAE and OM stand at the same pedestal whereas BH and KW OGD portals are lagging behind. Originality/value: While the OGD quality has been investigated in extant literature, the MQ of the OGD portals for the GCC countries has not been investigated so far – the present study seeks to plug this gap. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

StatePol includes sociodemographic characteristics such as age, sex, and birthplace, as well as career data such as memberships and offices in parliamentary party groups, committees, parliamentary presidencies, and government cabinets for every parliamentary and cabinet member on the German state level. The added value of the database lies in the fact that it offers highly fine-grained data capturing day-by-day changes within legislative periods. As a result, StatePol contains a total of 22,379,186 daily observations of 6946 individual decision-makers in the German federal states, including information on their positions and mandates in legislative and executive realms. We illustrate potential applications of StatePol by exploring the descriptive representation of sex, age, and regional origin (eastern/western Germany) in the German states. We find that the proportion of women in the state parliaments has stagnated at around 30\% since the early 2000s, with considerable differences between parties and their parliamentary groups. We also observe a steady increase in the average age of the members of parliament, particularly among those of the Greens and the Left. While politicians of East German origin dominate in the parliaments and governments of the East German states, they are less represented in West German state parliaments and governments. In contrast, decision-makers born in West Germany consistently make up a substantial proportion of all state cabinet members. The database is publicly available, allowing researchers to comprehensively examine various questions on representation in the German context. This research note is accompanied by a homepage allowing users to explore the full potential of StatePol and to download the data. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: While genomic data sharing can facilitate important health research and discovery benefits, these must be balanced against potential privacy risks and harms to individuals. Understanding public attitudes and perspectives on data sharing is important given these potential risks and to inform genomic research and policy that aligns with public preferences and needs. Methods: A cross sectional online survey measured attitudes towards genomic data sharing among members of the general public in an Eastern Canadian province. Results: Results showed a moderate comfort level with sharing genomic data, usually into restricted scientific databases with controlled access. Much lower comfort levels were observed for sharing data into open or publicly accessible databases. While respondents largely approved of sharing genomic data for health research permitted by a research ethics board, many general public members were concerned with who would have access to their data, with higher rates of approval for access from clinical or academic actors, but much more limited approval of access from commercial entities or governments. Prior knowledge about sequencing and about research ethics boards were both related to data sharing attitudes. Conclusions: With evolving regulations and guidelines for genomics research and data sharing, it is important to consider the perspectives of participants most impacted by these changes. Participant information materials and informed consent documents must be explicit about the safeguards in place to protect genomic data and the policies governing the sharing of data. Increased public awareness of the role of research ethics boards and of the need for genomic data sharing more broadly is also needed. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Open Government efforts are criticized for providing limited value. Instead of looking at a value, we investigate the usefulness of web-based open government portals and apps. Specifically, we investigated the relationship between digital transparency and usefulness. We analyzed perceived digital transparency and usefulness in a survey of 112 respondents using Partial Least Square (PLS) and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The results show that perceived functionality, transparency, and efficiency influence usefulness but that functionality of apps and efficiency are more important than transparency. Usefulness can be created without having high levels of transparency, as the public wants answers to their questions. Apps should be designed for efficient use, as users have limited time and resources. Apps having pre-defined functional views can be useful to provide quick insight but might limit transparency by not offering other views and insights. Opening raw data using portals can provide higher levels of transparency, although more time and effort are needed to analyze. Both portals providing access to raw data and apps having pre-defined views are needed for open government and transparency as they serve other stakeholder groups and purposes. © 2023 The Authors},

It focuses on ecosystems of data-driven modelling and experts who use government public health data. This study presents a conceptual framework that suggests effective data ecosystems undergo organic adaptation, display institutional leadership, and respond instrumentally to policymakers’ information needs. It examines how Australia’s infectious disease data ecosystem performed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. In-depth interviews with data experts involved in infectious disease modelling in Australia revealed trade-offs within and between organic, institutional and instrumental dimensions, which COVID-19 exacerbated. The article concludes that data ecosystems represent a hybrid form of policymaking in practice and that tensions must be managed to maximise the contributions of data ecosystems to facilitate evidence-informed decision-making. • © Authors 2024},

	abstract = {Capture fisheries production sector, which is the main source of consumed fish in Kenya has been declining over the years, causing huge deficit in fish supply in local market. Even though aquaculture has been fronted as a step-gap measure, there are still eminent fish supply gaps, prompting importation of frozen tilapia, mainly from China. However, the imported fish has attracted numerous socioeconomic debates between proponents and opponents of fish imports, almost in equal measure. This study investigated the socio-economic consequences of the imported tilapia in the local fish market and value chain linkages in Kisumu County. Primary data were collected using direct interviews with pre-set questionnaires fed into Open Data Kit (ODK) platform, and observations from 60 randomly selected fishermen and 60 fish farmers, 100 fish traders and 96 households. Key Informant Interviews (KII) and Focused Group Discussions (FGDs) were also conducted. About 57\% of the respondents processed and traded on the imported frozen tilapia, 27\% of them traded on fish from capture fisheries, while 16 \% traded on fish from the local aquaculture sector. Imported tilapia was the cheapest at Ksh. 200/kg compared to the locally produced tilapia at Ksh. 320/kg. At least 62 \% of the households in Kisumu consumed imported tilapia regularly due to lower prices and availability. About 46 \% of the respondents have gained direct employment and experienced improved socio-economic status due to the imported fish, of which 71 \% are youth and women. However, about 40\% of the respondents reported multiple job losses and degraded socio-economic status due to poor market for the locally produced tilapia, whether from the capture or culture sector. The study concluded that the importation of frozen tilapia can potentially reduce socioeconomic returns from the local fisheries and aquaculture value chains. A rational approach is to optimize local fish production to saturate the local market and potentially out-price the imported frozen tilapia. Appropriate government policies tackling the importation of fish into the country can also help reduce the negative impacts of these imported fish on the local fish market systems. © 2022,African Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition and Development.

Hence, this study aims to compare the metrics and methodologies used to measure, benchmark, and rank governments' progress in open government data initiatives. Using a critical meta-analysis approach, we compare nine benchmarks with reference to meta-data, meta-methods, and meta-theories. This study finds that both existing open government data benchmarks and academic open data progress models use a great variety of metrics and methodologies, although open data impact is not usually measured. While several benchmarks’ methods have changed over time, and variables measured have been adjusted, we did not identify a similar pattern for academic open data progress models. This study contributes to open data research in three ways: 1) it reveals the strengths and weaknesses of existing open government data benchmarks and academic open data progress models; 2) it reveals that the selected open data benchmarks employ relatively similar measures as the theoretical open data progress models; and 3) it provides an updated overview of the different approaches used to measure open government data initiatives’ progress. Finally, this study offers two practical contributions: 1) it provides the basis for combining the strengths of benchmarks to create more comprehensive approaches for measuring governments’ progress in open data initiatives; and 2) it explains why particular countries are ranked in a certain way. This information is essential for governments and researchers to identify and propose effective measures to improve their open data initiatives. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Whilst learning analytics is still nascent in most African higher education institutions, many African higher education institutions use learning platforms and analytic services from providers outside of the African continent. A critical consideration of the protection of data privacy on the African continent and its implications for learning analytics in African higher education is therefore needed. In this paper, we map the current state of legal and regulatory environments and frameworks on privacy to establish their implications for learning analytics. This scoping review of privacy regulations in 32 African countries, complemented by 15 scholarly papers, revealed that there are numerous national and regional legislation and regulatory frameworks, providing clear pointers pertaining to (student) data privacy to governments, higher education institutions and researchers. As such, the findings of this research have implications for African higher education to ensure not only legal compliance but also to oversee and safeguard student data privacy as part of their fiduciary duty. This research provides crucial insights regarding the importance of context for thinking about the expansion and institutional adoption of learning analytics. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Personal data have become commodified and are regarded as a valuable commercial asset. The commercial value of data relies on the collection and analysis of increasing volumes, granularity, variety and velocity of personal data (both identifiable and aggregated). Africa and African higher education are regarded as new data frontiers to be exploited. What this paper adds This paper, for the first time, makes an attempt to map privacy legislation and academic research on (student) data privacy in the African continent. Maps key implications for African higher educations to consider in collecting, analysing, using and sharing student data. It provides pointers for a research agenda pertaining to student data privacy on the African continent. Implications for practice and/or policy African higher education institutions should consider student data privacy when entering into service level agreements with educational technology and platform providers. African governments should develop common data sharing frameworks to facilitate cross-border data transfer.

	abstract = {This study aimed to assess the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) school-related information New York City residents sought through the 311 Call Center. July to November inquiries were downloaded from the NYC Open Data website for 2018–2020. Calls were categorized as related to “Schools”, “Access”, “Food”, “Hospitals”, “Transportation”, and “Unemployment”. Overall call types, and among school-related calls, detailed call types, were compared over the years, using chi-squared tests. School-related inquiries increased by 71\% from 2018 to 2020. During 2020, the most common (49\%, n = 22,471) call description was “Coronavirus and Schools”, encompassing calls about learning options, safety, and resources. Spikes in these calls corresponded to official announcements, including those about Fall reopening plans (August 31: n = 678; September 1: n = 624) and schedules and staffing (September 16th: n = 1043; September 17th: n = 713), and after the start of in-person learning (September 21: n = 680). This study demonstrates that as government officials updated NYC schooling plans for Fall 2020, there were increased concerns among NYC residents. Future COVID-19 schooling changes need to be conveyed clearly and disseminated effectively in order to avoid confusion about NYC’s pandemic learning strategy and to address health and safety concerns. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Control over the absence of knowledge facilitates certain policy outcomes being deflected, obscured, or magnified in a way that furthers political, personal, or institutional ends. Applying previous work on ignorance studies and agnotology to the development of Cambodian drought policy, the paper demonstrates how data gaps, restrictions on data sharing, and obstacles to data dissemination serve institutional interests and shape policy development. It proceeds in three parts, each reflecting one aspect of drought sensing in Cambodia and more broadly: hydrological, meteorological, and agricultural. First, how data on the Mekong River is shaped by regional geopolitics. Second, how national rainfall and flood data reflect the political geography of sub-national government administration. Third, how this multi-scalar landscape of political and institutional interests links data generation, data dissemination and adaptation policy, closing certain adaptation pathways, whilst opening others. © 2022},

To achieve this objective, the elements with which these public policies were designed are compared. The central argument of this article is that the good results obtained by these two countries in terms of transparency are due, in some measure, to the fact that their respective open data policies were designed under the principles of quality, relevance and social reuse of information. Thus, one of the main contributions of this analysis is the identification of the necessary elements to formulate effective actions of transparency and government openness. © 2022, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

The paper is based on semi-structured interviews with experienced Open Data experts and provides insights into rejecting or negative attitudes as well as resistance to Open Data by administrative employees and thus, provides explanations for the reluctance such as perceived high risks associated with the implementation of Open Data. At the same time, experiences regarding barriers, like an insufficient technical framework for Open Data are presented.

	abstract = {The methodology used by the First Street Foundation Wildfire Model (FSF-WFM) to compute estimates of the 30-year, climate-adjusted aggregate wildfire hazard for the contiguous United States at 30 m horizontal resolution is presented. The FSF-WFM integrates several existing methods from the wildfire science community and implements computationally efficient and scalable modeling techniques to allow for new high-resolution, CONUS-wide hazard generation. Burn probability, flame length, and ember spread for the years 2022 and 2052 are computed from two ten-year representative Monte Carlo simulations of wildfire behavior, utilizing augmented LANDFIRE fuel estimates updated with all the available disturbance information. FSF-WFM utilizes ELMFIRE, an open-source, Rothermel-based wildfire behavior model, and multiple US Federal Government open data sources to drive the simulations. LANDFIRE non-burnable fuel classes within the wildland–urban interface (WUI) are replaced with fuel estimates from machine-learning models, trained on data from historical fires, to allow the propagation of wildfire through the WUI in the model. Historical wildfire ignition locations and NOAA’s hourly time series of surface weather at 2.5 km resolution are used to drive ELMFIRE to produce wildfire hazards representative of the 2022 and 2052 conditions at 30 m resolution, with the future weather conditions scaled to the IPCC CMIP5 RCP4.5 model ensemble predictions. Winds and vegetation were held constant between the 2022 and 2052 simulations, and climate change’s impacts on the future fuel conditions are the main contributors to the changes observed in the 2052 results. Non-zero wildfire exposure is estimated for 71.8 million out of 140 million properties across CONUS. Climate change impacts add another 11\% properties to this non-zero exposure class over the next 30 years, with much of this change observed in the forested areas east of the Mississippi River. “Major” aggregate wildfire exposure of greater than 6\% over the 30-year analysis period from 2022 to 2052 is estimated for 10.2 million properties. The FSF-WFM represents a notable contribution to the ability to produce property-specific, climate-adjusted wildfire risk assessments in the US. © 2022 by the authors.},

Therefore, most previous studies on open data have focused on e-government. Consequently, an open data service industry committed to providing innovative value-added data application services has emerged in Taiwan, with small-and medium-sized enterprises being the driving force. However, in a complex industrial environment, enterprises need to promote efficient data services development by developing a cross-disciplinary business ecosystem cooperatively. Nevertheless, few studies have discussed the open data service industry from the perspective of business ecosystems, making it impossible for enterprises to evaluate the business ecosystem of open data services built by them. In this study, we used the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy decision-making and trial evaluation laboratory methods to construct five evaluation dimensions and thirty-one evaluation criteria. We organized them into an evaluation scale to measure the business ecosystem’s performance of open data services built by enterprises. Then, using the case analysis method, we tested the applicability of the evaluation scale. This study examined the assessment scale of ecosystem construction in the open data industry, from the perspective of a business ecosystem, and analyzed the importance of each key criterion. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Corpus linguistics is increasingly employed to explore large, publicly-available datasets such as newspaper texts, government speeches and online fora. However, comparatively few corpora exist where the subject matter concerns sensitive topics about living individuals since, due to their highly personal and confidential nature, these texts are hard to access and raise difficult ethical questions around secondary data analysis. One exception is the Writing in professional social work practice (WiSP) corpus, comprising texts written by UK-based professional social workers in the course of their daily work and now available to other researchers through the ReShare archive. This paper focuses on the challenges involved in building the WiSP corpus and the epistemological and ethical issues raised. Two key aspects of research practice are discussed: data anonymisation and dataset archiving. Specifically, the paper explores decision-making around anonymisation and an ethically-informed rationale for treating some texts as ‘not for sharing’, leading to the decision to create two corpora: one for the research team and a further anonymised and slightly reduced version for archiving. The paper explores what the WiSP corpora (Corpus 1 and Corpus 2) contribute to understandings about social work writing, the extent to which the two corpora enable different analyses and whether the existence of two corpora is problematic from a corpus linguistic perspective. The paper concludes by considering how the ethical decisions around corpus creation of sensitive texts raise questions about key principles in corpus linguistics. © 2021},

Though the sheer quantity of data available for free usage is steadily increasing worldwide, its average quality usually stays well below the minimum threshold required for value creation. In contrast, there is now growing evidence that the use of data has enormous potential for the economy and society, including research and the progress of science. Unfortunately, useful datasets are usually locked in and when actually made accessible, suffer from the same limitations mentioned before. Maybe the time is ripe to undervalue the generalized disclosure of government data in favor of an appropriately incentivized and targeted creation of actionable bases of new IT applications. We present four cases touching upon the issues and potentials of service design, urban innovation, and data-related policies. We identify two possible ways of tackling the highlighted market failure: direct subsidies to government bodies or agencies engaged in disclosing their own datasets and keeping them clean and accessible over time or new regulations that establish more productive data ecosystems, rewarding knowledge creation rather than mere data ownership. © 2021 by the authors.

However, when conventional financial analysis and audit techniques are adopted from the corporate sector, they may prove to be irrelevant for assessing the societal impacts of universities.

Research Objective: This study aims to measure the impact of economic openness on government expenditure (government size) by categorizing it into trade and capital openness. The Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model is used to measure the long-run and short-run impact of economic openness on government size. Data and Methods: Annual time series data from the World Bank Open Data on World Development Indicators (WDI) from 1997 to 2021 is used. The study ex-amines the relationship between government expenditure, trade openness, and capital openness. Results: The findings show that higher trade openness leads to a significant increase in government size, while more capital openness results in a reduction in the size of the government. The study also highlights the impact of current account deficits and national income on government size, with liberal trade policies leading to a widening current account deficit. The positive correlation between national income and government size supports Wagner’s Law of “Increasing State Activity.” Conclusion: The study suggests that policymakers should adopt a careful approach to liberal policies that encourage trade and capital openness, as an overly liberalized approach could harm macroeconomic factors such as fiscal and current account balances. The study also underscores the challenges that nations like Russia face when entering the global markets for goods beyond oil exports. © D. Mehta, 2023.},

	abstract = {Transparency has drawn considerable international attention as an umbrella term covering issues relating to the struggle against corruption, the design of more open and participatory government and institutional, corporate, and social agent accountability. It is likewise associated with open data and guaranteed access to public information. However, transparency also has a second important dimension, viz. public disclosure, whereby institutions are required to furnish citizens with public information in their interest. Assessment of both dimensions of transparency poses problems and difficulties. The present article discusses the results of applying the TransPa\_BA tool to assess public disclosure in 202 archives and libraries (information units) under the aegis of different government bodies. This tool proposes a series of indicators to measure active disclosure by public libraries and archives in keeping with the provisions of Spanish Act 19/2013 of 9 December on Transparency, Access to Public Information and Good Governance. The indicators and their respective parameters (content, form, reusability, accessibility, dating and updating/validity) establish general outlines enabling these institutions to enhance their transparency by furnishing not only society in general, but also their stakeholders, with information regarding their activities and performance. Accessibility of active public disclosure-related documents was found to be wanting in all but university libraries. As a collective learning tool for information unit managers, TransPa\_BA can be used to monitor and gradually improve transparency in libraries and archives. © 2023, El Profesional de la Informacion.

	abstract = {Since many years libraries, archives and museums, the institutions entrusted with the dissemination and conservation of cultural heritage, contributed to metada standards definition, meta-dating methodologies and metadata representation in different syntaxes, by partecipating to national projects and international initiatives. Management systems and catalogs used in these contexts borrow from information and telecommunication technology tools, metodoligies and techniques to generate, organize, share and use various types of metadata. But the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) area is not only a supplier of technological tools and solutions as it also constitutes a rich basin in which metadata plays a fundamental role in designing architectures, modeling information systems and implementing services. Through an overview that includes national and European initiatives, especially in the digital transformation process of the public sector, this paper aims to offer a look to metadata beyond the traditional boundary of libraries and other cultural institutions and to underline some relevant aspects such as standardization, sharing, reuse and metadata quality assessment. This framework highlights the need to carry on with the path of cooperation between different functional domains and organizational contexts in order to consolidate and extend the (re)use of metadata schemes, ontologies and controlled vocabularies both in the redesign of digitized processes and in the implementation of services supporting them. By undertaking since design early stages a multidisciplinary approach based on metadata standards can ensure greater flexibility and higher interoperability. This vision requires the enhancement of intersectorial skills that meld metadata methodologies and syntaxes representation basic knowledge with the ability to model functional domains using metadata schemes and ontologies. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has, from the outset, been characterized by a strong focus on real-time data intelligence and the use of data-driven technologies. Against this backdrop, this article investigates the impacts of the pandemic on Scottish local government's data practices and, in turn, whether the crisis acted as a driver for digital transformation. Mobilizing the literatures on digital government transformation, and on the impacts of crises on public administrations, the article provides insights into the dynamics of digital transformation during a heightened period of acute demands on the public sector. The research evidences an intensification of public sector data use and sharing in Scottish local authorities, with focus on health-related data and the integration of existing datasets to gather local intelligence. The research reveals significant changes related to the technical and social systems of local government organizations. These include the repurposing and adoption of information systems, the acceleration of inter and intraorganizational data sharing processes, as well as changes in ways of working and in attitudes toward data sharing and collaborations. Drawing on these findings, the article highlights the importance of identifying and articulating specific data needs in relation to concrete policy questions in order to render digital transformation relevant and effective. The article also points to the need of addressing the persistent systemic challenges underlying public sector data engagement through, on one hand, sustained investment in data capabilities and infrastructures and, on the other, support for cross-organizational collaborative spaces and networks. © The Author(s), 2022.

	abstract = {Autonomous systems have been a key segment of disruptive technologies for which data are constantly collected, processed, and shared to enable their operations. The internet of things facilitates the storage and transmission of data and data sharing is vital to power their development. However, privacy, cybersecurity, and trust issues have ramifications that form distinct and unforeseen barriers to sharing data. This paper identifies six types of barriers to data sharing (technical, motivational, economic, political, legal, and ethical), examines strategies to overcome these barriers in different autonomous systems, and proposes recommendations to address them. We traced the steps the Singapore government has taken through regulations and frameworks for autonomous systems to overcome barriers to data sharing. The results suggest specific strategies for autonomous systems as well as generic strategies that apply to a broader set of disruptive technologies. To address technical barriers, data sharing within regulatory sandboxes should be promoted. Promoting public-private collaborations will help in overcoming motivational barriers. Resources and analytical capacity must be ramped up to overcome economic barriers. Advancing comprehensive data sharing guidelines and discretionary privacy laws will help overcome political and legal barriers. Further, enforcement of ethical analysis is necessary for overcoming ethical barriers in data sharing. Insights gained from this study will have implications for other jurisdictions keen to maximize data sharing to increase the potential of disruptive technologies such as autonomous systems in solving urban problems. © 2023 The Author(s).

Nonetheless, questions remain about whether OGD is indeed empowering citizens to participate or if the data that governments publish is more reflective of the interests of non-citizen stakeholders. Using the metadata of 2607 publicly available datasets scraped from New York City's open data portal, this exploratory study uses qualitative content analysis to identify what types of data are published and what the data say about OGD's potential as a tool for advancing inclusion in democratic processes. The analysis focused particularly on the datasets' relevance to five particular stakeholder groups: citizens, private sector firms, nonprofits, researchers, and the city's internal agencies. Findings showed that non-citizen-relevant datasets not only outnumbered citizen-relevant datasets by a large margin but they were also viewed and downloaded at higher rates too. The implications of this for inclusion in democratic processes are discussed, including power imbalances among OGD user groups, the discretionary power data publishers possess, and, ultimately, whether the types of data cities publish is sufficient for empowering an informed citizenry, as an effective democracy demands. © 2022 - IOS Press.},

	abstract = {The transport of goods, equipment and waste to, from, in and through urban areas (urban logistics) are essential for the economic vitality of the city but at the same time make urban environmental and social targets more difficult to achieve The European Green Deal and the UN Sustainability Goals also challenge the ways of addressing planning and management. At the same time Covid 19 has led to new challenges for urban logistics together with changes in consumer purchasing and travel patterns. Digitalisation offers new ways of collecting data and providing input to planning and modelling of urban logistics that might alleviate these challenges. This article addresses how digitalisation and especially sensors can contribute to new forms of data for analysis and play a role in developing sustainable digital urban logistics measures and plans through data collection and sharing. The research contains empirical insights from a survey and workshop in Norway. The results from the survey show that sensors are the digital solution that practitioners see as most useful for urban transport. This is supported by results from the workshop supporting a sensor scenario. When it comes to the digitalisation process, the practitioners expect that the different levels of government will facilitate digitalisation of urban logistics and most practitioners have the opinion that all levels of government should do more to facilitate new solutions Testing should take place as collaboration between private and public actors. Due to Covid 19 the government level is seen to have an important role for exchange of information and advice, and for giving economic incentives and support, rather than providing law and regulatory changes or the reorganisation of public services. The local level is considered to have an especially important role for digitalisation including data for modelling, planning or public procurement procedures. The article addresses these questions by reference to the partnerships for freight transport in London and Gothenburg. This article adds insights for planning practitioners into how sensors will challenge as well as provide new possibilities, to suggest new paths for planning and modelling urban logistics and an amplified role for freight partnerships.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study explored to what extent and how researchers in five Korean government research institutes that implement research data management practices share their research data and investigated the challenges they perceive regarding data sharing. Methods: The study collected survey data from 224 respondents by posting a link to a SurveyMonkey questionnaire on the homepage of each of the five research institutes from June 15 to 29, 2022. Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted. Results: Among 148 respondents with data sharing experience, the majority had shared some or most of their data. Restricted data sharing within a project was more common than sharing data with outside researchers on request or making data publicly available. Sharing data directly with researchers who asked was the most common method of data sharing, while sharing data via institutional repositories was the second most common method. The most frequently cited factors impeding data sharing included the time and effort required to organize data, concerns about copyright or ownership of data, lack of recognition and reward, and concerns about data containing sensitive information. Conclusion: Researchers need ongoing training and support on making decisions about access to data, which are nuanced rather than binary. Research institutes’ commitment to developing and maintaining institutional data repositories is also important to facilitate data sharing. To address barriers to data sharing, it is necessary to implement research data management services that help reduce effort and mitigate concerns about legal issues. Possible incentives for researchers who share data should also continue to be explored. © 2023 Korean Council of Science Editors},

Bibliometric analysis, comparative analysis, cluster analysis, and principal component analysis (PCA) were the methods used in this research. From the comparative analysis, 18 indicators were identified as conforming and 41 as partially conforming. Thus, 20\% of the ObservaSampa indicators adhere to the ISO standards. The PCA applied to the conforming indicators shows component 1 is related to socioeconomic dimensions, while component 2 refers to social policy, with both appraisals confirmed by cluster analysis. Measuring and presenting city data in compliance with indicator standards is relevant because they open the possibility of comparing different cities.

This article analyzes the context of open innovation (OI) applications and initiatives that characterized public innovation trends and impacted government agencies' responses to contain different consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in four critical areas: economic recovery strategies, logistics and supply chain, digital health-care partnerships, and collaborations. We show how policy responses increased the uptake and upscaling of OI strategies in Kenya and South Africa. In both countries, government agencies, among other things, upgraded innovative or created online integrated portals for instant data sharing and used knowledge management platforms to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic prevalence in transportation systems and the delivery of vaccines. These enabled effective policy communication and tracing of COVID-19 patients, organizing the population for the vaccination drive, and generating timely data for further action in the four mentioned sectors.

Gaming can help civil servants to practise opening data and can change their behaviour to support the opening of more data. In this article, the effect of playing a game is evaluated in an experiment in which several factors that influence the opening of data are compared before and after the game. The benefits appeared in unexpected ways and areas. Data management, privacy and security knowledge was transferred using the game, the perception of benefits showed significant changes, and behavioural intention was positively affected. Points for practitioners: Civil servants’ behaviour influences how public policies are enacted. The release of open data by governments is related by many as crucial for increasing public transparency and civic participation, and generating new economic opportunities. Games can influence the attitude of civil servants and, consequently, change governments’ decisions. Transferring knowledge and providing insights from new experiences can influence civil servants’ attitudes to open data. Moreover, governments can use games to influence civil servants’ attitudes. © The Author(s) 2020.},

Across the Global South, foreign donor-funded digital platforms emphasize transparency, accountability and data sharing while echoing colonial projects that consolidated state-based territorial knowledge. This article brings political geography scholarship on state and counter-mapping together with new work on the political ecology of data to highlight a contemporary dimension of territorialization, one in which state actors seek to consolidate and authorize national geospatial information onto digital platforms. We call attention to the role of data infrastructures in contemporary resource control, arguing that territorializing data both extends state territorialization onto digital platforms and, paradoxically, provides new avenues for non-state actors to claim land. Drawing on interviews, document review, and long-term fieldwork, we compare the origins, institutionalization and realization of Indonesia and Myanmar's ‘One Map’ projects. Both projects aimed to create a government-managed online spatial data platform, building on national mapping and management traditions while responding to new international incentives, such as climate change mitigation in Indonesia and good democratic governance in Myanmar. While both projects encountered technical difficulties and evolved during implementation, different national histories and political trajectories resulted in the embrace and expansion of the program in Indonesia but reluctant participation and eventual crisis in Myanmar. Together, these cases show how spatial data infrastructures can both extend state control over space and offer opportunities for contesting or reimagining land and nation, even as such infrastructures remain embedded in local power relations. © 2022 The Authors},

The objective of this work is to identify the level of openness of data in Brazilian government portals, map initiatives for the organization of information, and compliance with legislation. The clipping comprises the Brazilian government portals, specifically: two maintained by the Federal Government, one by the Government of the Federal District, and the Governments of the twenty-six Brazilian States. We used two instruments to evaluate the portals: the five-star rating scheme for open data and the fourteen principles for open government data. The methodology comprises documentary research, using instruments for analysis and evaluation of the clipping in a qualitative approach with a descriptive purpose. The results showed that only the Brazilian Open Data Portal reached the fourth star. As for the second instrument, the Federal Government and the states of Alagoas and Espírito Santo comply with the largest number of principles. States like Amazonas, Rio de Janeiro, and Paraná have the worst results. We have concluded that Brazilian government portals have a low supply of open data, rarely structured and machine-readable, without standardization or interoperability. © 2022, Universidade de Brasilia.

	abstract = {Government policies focused on Open Government Data (OGD) often aim to stimulate the provision of public, interoperable data towards any user, including lay citizens, through online portals. However, these OGD portals are mostly developed for expert users. This hinders the realization of critical values such as transparency, empowerment, and equality of access. Following a Design Science Research approach, this study aims to examine how gamification can help tailor OGD portals for lay citizens. As a pre-condition to this goal, we identify requirements toward OGD portals through twenty interviews with experts and lay citizens. Compared to expert users, lay citizens expect an OGD portal with a more playful interface, vulgarized content, customized visualizations, and transparency-related datasets in a human-readable format. Second, we develop our research artifact, the OGD portal prototype, implementing fifteen design propositions using gamification theory to address lay citizens’ requirements. Third, the evaluation with ten lay citizens reveals the perceived usefulness of the design propositions. Badges were evaluated as most useful to highlight portal relevance. This study contributes to OGD theory development by identifying lay citizens' requirements towards OGD use. Furthermore, this study is the first to reveal the usefulness of implementing notions from gamification theory into OGD portal design. Finally, practitioners can use our findings to make OGD portals more inclusive and thus contribute to attaining key OGD policy objectives. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The profitable opportunities and abundance of data made available by cities attract ICT corporations that possess the resources and knowledge to make cities smart. However, this often leads corporate actors to monopolise the data collected and generated. This poses risks for privacy and the ways in which personal data are used and commercialised. Existing work on business-to-government (B2G) data sharing and data collaboratives has explored the technical and organisational issues involved in corporate data sharing with public authorities. However, many studies remain focused on voluntary corporate data releases.

Despite this, the effectiveness of these normative instructions is unknown, as well as its inducing and lasting effects in the diffusion of these innovations, especially in Brazil. This study aims to understand the effects of normative induction. Design/methodology/approach: The adoption of risk management, integrity \& ethics and information security practices was evaluated over a decade (2009 to 2019), including the adoption behavior of more than 200 Brazilian federal agencies. Public open data were collected and analyzed with multinomial logistic regression. Findings: The normative instructions’ effectiveness in propagating the evaluated practices is remarkable; however, its mere development by the superior bodies cannot be considered enough since the general adoption index can be considered good but not excellent. No evaluated practice reached a saturation level above 75\%. Research limitations/implications: This paper contributes to bringing the international literature’s generic knowledge on the adoption of innovation to the specific Brazilian public administration context, providing insightful implications for policymakers, public managers and researchers. Practical implications: This work is unique, as it systematically analyzes multiple innovation adoption and presents excellent opportunities for future researchers by reproducing all scripts and automation developed. Furthermore, all data are available and hosted on public platforms with detailed steps and documentation. Social implications: The use of open data from governmental sources allows enhanced transparency and the discovery of affecting variables while observing innovation adoption in the public administration. Originality/value: The presence of normative instructions and their adoption rate is rarely measured in the Brazilian public administration. © 2022, Gustavo de Freitas Alves and Carlos Denner dos Santos.},

	abstract = {The increasing globalization has led to significant transformations in the world's economic and political landscapes, with most countries and regions undergoing socioeconomic transitions and spatial reconfigurations. In this context, polycentric patterns have become prominent representations of urban landscapes, and scientific cognition of the urban polycentric evolutionary processes and planning practices is instrumental in understanding the development logic of China during its economic transition. This article reviewed existing literature on the measurement, mechanism, performance, and planning practice of polycentric urban development and discussed its policy implications. The definition of polycentricity covers three dimensions—morphological polycentricity and functional polycentricity reflect urban polycentricity based on static and dynamic perspectives, respectively, while governance polycentricity involves cooperation in strategic planning decisions and policy implementation. The measurement of urban polycentricity is first based on the identification of centers and sub- centers to further measure the degree of polycentric development in different dimensions. In terms of driving mechanisms, the formation of polycentric spatial structure results from the tradeoffs between market forces and government planning interventions and is also the spatial manifestation of the intertwining socioeconomic development and institutions, which is triggered and promoted by different leading factors. Notably, political power from the local institutions is a critical driving force shaping polycentric urban development. Research on the performance of polycentricity shows that polycentric development strategies may bring certain negative externalities at the practical level while optimizing spatial organization, and further evaluation of the importance and rationality of polycentricity is worthy of in- depth consideration. In terms of planning practice, polycentric development is a key measure for central and local governments to carry out spatial governance and achieve coordinated development, but the effectiveness of planning implementation is limited. In the future, emphasis should be placed on the innovation of analytical and theoretical frameworks of polycentric research, especially considering the development background of China. Also, as open data gets more widely available, scholars can employ multiple data sources to examine polycentric urban development at different scales and in different dimensions. At the same time, attention should be paid to the mechanism of the formation and evolution of polycentric spatial structure, the multiple performances, and the integration and conflict in multi-level governance. In this way, it assesses whether polycentric development can be used as a tool for strategic spatial planning and whether it can facilitate achieving a balance between space supply and demand while maximizing overall benefits, thus leading to effective spatial governance and regulation practice. © 2022, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

But when advancing legal data sharing regimes, there is an inevitable need to balance public and private interests. While the European Commission continues to push for more binding rules on data sharing between private businesses, public undertakings are already covered by mandatory rules. Exploring how the law addresses their data offers valuable lessons on the reconciliation of market reasoning with the public interest. In particular, this article inquires into the recast Open Data and Public Sector Information Directive, the Data Governance Act, and different national rules which regulate access to and re-use of public undertakings' data. It identifies five striking characteristics and discusses their potential and limitations for regulating data sharing by private undertakings. The implications serve as a guidepost for advancing the wider debate on building a single market for data in the EU. Some of them are already reflected in the upcoming EU Data Act. © 2023 The Author.

Therefore, this paper proposed constructing an urban problem knowledge graph that would include urban problems’ causality and the related cost information in budget sheets. In addition, this paper proposed a method for detecting vicious cycles of urban problems using SPARQL queries with inference rules from the knowledge graph.

The study showcases the benefits of open government data and the opportunities and challenges toward the development of a national open data policy. Web content analysis and document analysis were used to collect data concerning the readiness of the country in implementing open data activities. The open data barometer was used to gather qualitative data which is essential in assessing the preparedness of the country in opening up government and research data. Content analysis was used to analyse the data which was presented thematically based on the objectives of the study. The findings indicated that the Government of Zimbabwe has endorsed a couple of open data frameworks though some projects are done by non-governmental organizations. The major challenge is implementation of these conventions and commitment to make the data accessible. The results indicated that open data must be made available and accessible within Zimbabwe as a matter of national policy. The author recommends the need for advocacy and continuous awareness creation among the stakeholders so that a national open data policy can be crafted and enacted. The enactment of a national open data policy would guide the use of and access to government data and research data which is valuable in research. Copyright © 2022 Chigwada.},

As a result, assumptions about the drivers, challenges, and impacts of AI in government are far from conclusive. By using a case study that involves a large research university in England and two different county councils in a multiyear collaborative project around AI, we study the challenges that interorganizational collaborations face in adopting AI tools and implementing organizational routines to address them. Our findings reveal the most important challenges facing such collaborations: a resistance to sharing data due to privacy and security concerns, insufficient understanding of the required and available data, a lack of alignment between project interests and expectations around data sharing, and a lack of engagement across organizational hierarchy. Organizational routines capable of overcoming such challenges include working on-site, presenting the benefits of data sharing, reframing problems, designating joint appointments and boundary spanners, and connecting participants in the collaboration at all levels around project design and purpose. © The Author(s) 2020.},

At the same time, big data and real-time data analysis have taken on great importance and have been accompanied by unprecedented interest in sharing data among citizens, public administrations and other organisms, giving rise to what is known as the Collaborative Internet of Things. This growth in data and infrastructure must be accompanied by a software architecture that allows its exploitation. Although there are various proposals focused on the exploitation of the IoT at edge, fog and/or cloud levels, it is not easy to find a software solution that exploits the three tiers together, taking maximum advantage not only of the analysis of contextual and situational data at each tier, but also of two-way communications between adjacent ones. In this paper, we propose an architecture that solves these deficiencies by proposing novel technologies which are appropriate for managing the resources of each tier: edge, fog and cloud. In addition, the fact that two-way communications along the three tiers of the architecture is allowed considerably enriches the contextual and situational information in each layer, and substantially assists decision making in real time. The paper illustrates the proposed software architecture through a case study of respiratory disease surveillance in hospitals. As a result, the proposed architecture permits efficient communications between the different tiers responding to the needs of these types of IoT scenarios. © 2021 The Author(s)},

The results show that the criteria analyzed consider accessibility to public transport and urban opportunities as exclusive dimensions and only from the territorial proximity or walking distance perspective. Moreover, the proposed standards do not adequately contemplate load capacity, considering only areas of influence and ignoring the public transport capacity.

Then, the outputs of this literature review are used to compile a list of 16 dashboard design principles in the context of OGD. Next, we apply these design principles to build the Namur (Belgium) Budget Dashboard (NBDash) in order to provide a practical application of our research and use it for evaluation. Finally, we use NBDash as a use case to evaluate the usefulness of well-designed dashboards compared to individual visualizations through an experimental study. The results of the experimental design study with 108 participants suggest that the implementation of well-designed dashboards can be beneficial in encouraging the use of data on portals. In addition, the selection of meaningful metrics and the use of appropriate visualizations, all organized in a clear presentation, have proven to be the primary factors of successful dashboards. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Open data are considered an essential resource for governments, businesses, and citizens. In that context, open data portals have potential for creating enormous economic growth. Open data portals should allow the reuse of open data, ensure the efficiency of data transmission, and enable professional initiatives based on data reuse. However, there are portals that are inefficient because they do not allow reuse of their data. The objective of this work is to define and iden-tify open data portals that do not offer the possibility for professional reuse of their data. We refer to them as “pretender open data portals”. The following research questions are considered herein: What minimum criteria must an open data portal satisfy to enable professional reuse of open data? How can portals that do not meet these criteria be identified? And, what problems might these portals present, and how they might be solved? The results of an analysis of two sam-ples of open data portals in Spain reveal that 63.8\% and 56.1\% of the portals analyzed in 2019 and 2021, respectively, can be considered pretender open data portals. The existence of pretender open data portals can have negative economic and social impacts, such as wasting public resources and projecting a negative image of the government’s open data policies. To find coordination mechanisms to develop open data portals that, through the professional re-use of their data can create economic and social value, is one important challenge. The analysis of best practices of open data portals can be also a way to go in deep in the understanding of open data reuse impact not only from a professional standpoint. © 2022, El Profesional de la Informacion.

We investigate the determinants of sharing data for Malaysia’s spatial data infrastructure (SDI) and aim to define the model for spatial data-sharing of Malaysia’s local SDI. The main contribution of this paper is an explanation of the novel methodology to study factors that affect spatial data sharing including a new qualitative analysis method through an interview with people concerned in this field, including engineers, technicians and academics, which was undertaken in Kuala Lumpur, and a new methodology to identify the necessary approach that affects spatial data sharing. An interview and a questionnaire were used in this study as part of a sequential exploratory approach. Among land use, Plan Malaysia, and Telekom Malaysia Berhad TMOne, 15 participants were interviewed in-depth to obtain their responses, and 83 individuals took part in the survey questionnaires. Interview data were measured by content analysis, while questionnaire data were measured by partial least squares analysis. In the structural model analysis, Smart PLS was used to choose the fit items based on validity and reliability measurements. According to the hypothesis measurement, technology and organisation both significantly affect the practice of spatial data sharing, but human resources and spatial data do not significantly affect it. All R-Squared values represent a value above 56 per cent for the human resource aspect, technology aspect and spatial data aspect. However, the R-Square value for spatial data sharing is 47\%. Spatial data and human resources have a less substantial impact on spatial data sharing; hence, this study proposes a national awareness programme and mentoring to improve local SDI support for spatial data sharing. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of the moderate growth of government borrowing on debt sustainability in 11 Russian regions over about 10 years, starting in 2010. The current study aims to assess the debt sustainability of the Russian region’s budget by determining Euclidean distance budget constraints and cluster analysis. This study is based on the methodology of hierarchical cluster analysis, which makes it possible to isolate regions of accumulation of objects from the aggregate data and combine them into homogeneous segments. The central hypothesis of this study is that by using this method, it is possible to increase the accuracy of the values that limit budget constraints in a region’s financial system. This study, using open data from the Federal State Statistics Service, is based on a database of statistical, financial, and economic indicators of the Russian economy. The calculations include about 45 macroeconomic indicators, which reflect the ratios of socio-economic development of the region’s financial system. The methodology described in the paper for assessing the debt sustainability of budget policy proves the need to calculate six indicators and determine the debt limits for the regions of each cluster. It finds a need to reduce the high debt burden of 46\% of the regions belonging to the Northwestern Federal District. Confidence intervals for the debt limit suggest that the negative growth effect of high debt may start from levels of around 5\% of the debt-to-GDP ratio and about 43\% of the debt-to-revenue ratio. The results indicate that regions with a high level of debt sustainability include St. Petersburg city, the Leningrad region, and the Kaliningrad region. From a state debt policy perspective, the results provide additional arguments for debt reduction for the Republic of Komi, the Republic of Karelia, the Arkhangelsk region, and the Pskov region. The general conclusion of the study boils down to the need to reduce the debt burden of the budgets of some regions of the SFZO, as well as to the need to change the upper limits of debt, which are equally set for all regions by the Budget Code of the Russian Federation, to differentiated values of public domestic debt, taking into account the results obtained in the study. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for governments and health administrations at all levels to have an open data registry that facilitates decision-making in the planning and management of health resources and provides information to citizens on the evolution of the epidemic. The concept of “open data” includes the possibility of reutilization by third parties. Space and time are basic dimensions used to structure and interpret the data of the variables that refer to the health status of the people themselves. Hence, the main objective of this study is to evaluate whether the autonomous communities’ data files regarding Covid-19 are reusable to analyze the evolution of the disease in basic spatial and temporal analysis units at the regional and national levels. To this end, open data files containing the number of diagnosed cases of Covid-19 distributed in basic health or administrative spatial units and temporal units were selected from the portals of the Spanish autonomous communities. The presence of infection-related, demographic, and temporal variables, as well as the download format and metadata, were mainly evaluated. Whether the structure of the files was homogeneous and adequate for the application of spatial analysis techniques was also analyzed. The results reveal a lack of standardization in the collection of data in both spatial and temporal units and an absence of, or ambiguity in, the meaning of the variables owing to a lack of metadata. An inadequate structure was also found in the files of seven autonomous communities, which would require subsequent processing of the data to enable their reuse and the application of analysis and spatial modeling techniques, both when carrying out global analyses and when comparing patterns of evolution between different regions. © 2022, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Now societies can be better protected against such harrowing outbreaks by analysing the detailed genetic sequence data of new pathogens. Why, then, is this valuable epistemic resource frequently withheld by stakeholders – hamstringing the international response and potentially putting lives at risk? This article initiates the social scientific study of bioinformational diplomacy, that is, the emerging field of tensions, sensitivities, practices and enabling instruments surrounding the timely international exchange of bioinformation about global health emergencies. The article genealogically locates this nascent field at the intersection of molecularised life, informationalised biology and securitised health. It investigates the deeper political, economic and scientific problematisations that are engendering this burgeoning field. It finally analyses the emergent international instruments developed by governments, scientists and industry to facilitate more rapid global sharing of bioinformation through novel practices of data passporting. Overall, the in-depth study of bioinformational diplomacy reveals just how deeply, and even constitutively, international relations are entangled with the life sciences – by carefully tracing how laboratory practices of sequencing life at molecular scale also end up recontouring the play of sovereignty, power and security in international relations. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {Several public digital media, transparency portals, open data and repositories have contributed to citizens’ access to information. These changes also have a profound influence on the norms, principles and values that guide citizens’ social lives. But this large volume of data does not imply transparency. There are different organizational, technical, political, social and ethical barriers that limit access to information. The objective of this work was to debate the main ethical barriers to transparency and free access to information on public activities. Therefore, we performed qualitative research, of the descriptive nature, which started from the studies of access to public information, ethics and Government Open Data, to establish a link between the concepts. For data collection and analysis, bibliographic research was used. Data collection in this field was done through the Capes portal, with a time frame of the last 10 years. The empirical field focuses on Brazilian public administration bodies. Thus, it is observed that the ethical barriers identified in the research are the sharing of information from combined data sets, which cause privacy violations; data bias and discriminatory decisions by using data-based algorithms; privacy issues from discoveries of human habits through mass surveillance; data leakage; difficulties in adapting views to different audiences; uncertain ownership of data; misinformation; and somewhat more “sanitized” disseminated data. Which allows us to conclude that the research had as its contribution, the systematization of the process of access to information and the different possible identified barriers, which interfere in the ethical aspect for the transparency of public information. It is suggested for future research, empirical studies on intercultural ethical barriers concerning federal or state agencies, transparency and access to information, through the different channels offered by governments, government repositories portals or open data. © 2021 Imprensa da Universidade de Coimbra.

	abstract = {Flowing water resources and relatively fixed regional segmentation form a governance problem. The essence of horizontal collaborative governance is the establishment of coordination and cooperation processes between different independent and decentralized stakeholders in order to solve cross-regional public problems. As a result, the process of collaborative governance involves a jagged relationship of rights and responsibilities. This study attempts to explore how to achieve cross-regional intergovernmental joint prevention and treatment, and build a coordinated governance mechanism for a whole river basin. Based on data sources including local statistical yearbooks, open data of ecological environment departments and policy texts, this paper performs a comparative analysis of the current water quality status of various major water bodies in China and the relevant domestic ecological compensation systems. Based on this analysis, the current water quality situation is not optimistic. In order to strengthen the ecological and environmental management of river basins, more than 40 relevant systems and implementation schemes of ecological compensation for river basins have been introduced from the central government to the local government level since 2016, and 13 cross-provincial agreements (schemes) on horizontal ecological compensation for river basins have been signed. By analyzing various data and more than 53 systems (programs), it becomes apparent there are some problems in the governance of aquatic environments of river basins in China. These problems include a lack of laws and regulations on ecological compensation, imperfect coordination mechanisms, a single compensation mode and insufficient amounts of compensation. Based on this, this study proposes that China’s cross-regional river basin ecological compensation and collaborative governance mechanisms should start with differential governance; explore a variety of horizontal ecological compensation methods according to local conditions; improve cross-regional river basin collaborative mechanisms, laws and regulations; build a new path of horizontal independent collaboration; broaden the channels of financial compensation; and comprehensively improve the level of regional linkages in the governance of river basins. © 2023 by the authors.},

While much attention has been placed on travel bans, lockdown, social distancing, and economic stimulus packages, government dissemination of epidemic information as a policy instrument has received less attention. Based on 14,637 news items collected from the portals of 79 municipal governments in China, this study aims to 1) conduct a content analysis of news items and construct three key attributes of governments' practices of epidemic information dissemination, namely, comprehensiveness, responsiveness, and the protection of privacy, and 2) study the patterns and determinants of the dissemination of epidemic information. Our results show that these cities vary substantially in how they disseminate statistical data and information on individual cases of COVID-19 infections within their localities, which are shaped by government performance in open data, severity of the pandemic, cities' administrative level, population, and health sector capacities.

Drawing from semistructured interviews with managers and project leaders of twelve municipalities, the study contextualizes access to private sector data in the perspectives of those working in the field. The findings examine the four operational models to access data that featured more prominently in the interviews: data donorship, public procurement of data, data partnerships and pools, and data sharing obligations. The analysis highlights the power unbalances embedded in B2G data sharing as perceived by representatives of local administrations. In particular, the findings address the gap between municipalities in the opportunities to access private sector data of public interest, the lack of negotiating power of local administrations vis-à-vis private sector data holders and the strategies envisioned to foster more inclusive forms of data governance. © This paper is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.},

	abstract = {Depression accounts for a large share of the global disease burden, with an estimated 264 million people globally suffering from depression. Despite being one of the most common kinds of mental health (MH) disorders, much about depression remains unknown. There are limited data about depression, in terms of its occurrence, distribution, and wider social determinants. This work examined the use of novel data sources for assessing the scope and social determinants of depression, with a view to informing the reduction of the global burden of depression. This study focused on new and traditional sources of data on depression and its social determinants in two middle-income countries (LMICs), namely, Brazil and India. We identified data sources using a combination of a targeted PubMed search, Google search, expert consultations, and snowball sampling of the relevant literature published between October 2010 and September 2020. Our search focused on data sources on the following HEALTHY subset of determinants: healthcare (H), education (E), access to healthy choices (A), labor/employment (L), transportation (T), housing (H), and income (Y). Despite the emergence of a variety of data sources, their use in the study of depression and its HEALTHY determinants in India and Brazil are still limited. Survey-based data are still the most widely used source. In instances where new data sources are used, the most commonly used data sources include social media (twitter data in particular), geographic information systems/global positioning systems (GIS/GPS), mobile phone, and satellite imagery. Often, the new data sources are used in conjunction with traditional sources of data. In Brazil, the limited use of new data sources to study depression and its HEALTHY determinants may be linked to (a) the government’s outsized role in coordinating healthcare delivery and controlling the data system, thus limiting innovation that may be expected from the private sector; (b) the government routinely collecting data on depression and other MH disorders (and therefore, does not see the need for other data sources); and (c) insufficient prioritization of MH as a whole. In India, the limited use of new data sources to study depression and its HEALTHY determinants could be a function of (a) the lack of appropriate regulation and incentives to encourage data sharing by and within the private sector, (b) absence of purposeful data collection at subnational levels, and (c) inadequate prioritization of MH. There is a continuing gap in the collection and analysis of data on depression, possibly reflecting the limited priority accorded to mental health as a whole. The relatively limited use of data to inform our understanding of the HEALTHY determinants of depression suggests a substantial need for support of independent research using new data sources. Finally, there is a need to revisit the universal health coverage (UHC) frameworks, as these frameworks currently do not include depression and other mental health-related indicators so as to enable tracking of progress (or lack thereof) on such indicators. © 2021, The New York Academy of Medicine.},

	abstract = {The wave of government data opening has gradually swept the world since it rose from the United States in 2009. The purpose is not to open government data, but to release data value and drive economic and social development through data accessibility. At present, the impact of academic circles on government open data mostly stays in theoretical discussion, especially due to the lack of empirical tests. Using the multistage difference-in-difference (DID) model, this paper analyzes the panel data from 2009 to 2016 by taking two batches of Chinese cities with open data released in 2014 and 2105 as samples to test the impact of government data opening on urban innovation ability. The results show that the opening of government data significantly improves urban innovation abilities. After considering the heterogeneity and fixed effects of urban characteristics, the opening of government data still significantly improves urban innovation ability and shows a greater innovation driving role in cities with high levels of economic development, human capital, and infrastructure. Based on this, this paper believes that we should continue to promote the opening of government data, release the value of data, and pay attention to the Matthew effect between cities that may appear in the era of big data. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {This paper explores how climate risk information produced in the context of insurance-related activities can support public climate adaptation planning. The central contribution is to outline how relevant climate risk information can translate into behaviour change, and the drivers and barriers that influence this in Sub-Saharan Africa. The insurance industry has the potential to catalyse greater use of climate information, either through existing insurance transactions or through capacity building and investment in data sharing and collaboration. We investigate the interplay of climate risk information and insurance processes from two angles: the use of climate risk data by those who provide insurance – with information as an input to the underwriting process; and the catalyst role of insurance for governments to move towards anticipatory climate risk management. We apply a multi-method approach, combining insights from a survey of 40 insurance experts with key informant interviews and document analysis from three complementary case studies: indemnity-based insurance of private assets in South Africa; parametric sovereign risk pool in Malawi; and collaboration on risk analytics and risk management advice (no insurance) in Tanzania. The analysis offers a new perspective on the catalyst role of insurance by focusing on the ways in which political economy factors, particularly incentives and relationships, influence this process. Overall, there appears to be clear scope for a dynamic interaction between insurers and governments where symbiotic use and generation of climate risk information can advance mutual goals. However, that ambition faces many challenges that go beyond availability and suitability of data. Limited trust, unclear risk ownership and/or lack of incentives are key barriers, even if there is risk awareness and overall motivation to manage climate risks. The three cases show the importance of sustained cross-sectoral collaboration and capacity building to increase awareness and utilization of insurance-related climate risk information. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Purpose: Open government data (OGD) are considered as a technology capable of promoting transparency openness, and accountability, which in turn has a positive impact on innovation activities and creates responsive government, collaboration, cooperation, co-creation and participation. The purpose of this paper is to explore the adoption of OGD and open data portals among students, in an attempt to discover how governments can improve their actions in this respect. Design/methodology/approach: This study develops a behavioural intention-based analysis using constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, which is supplemented with additional constructs that meet the purpose of the study. In total, ten constructs divided into 33 items constituted the input for our study. Input data for the developed model have been collected through a structured questionnaire distributed between bachelor's and master's level students in three countries – the Czech Republic, India and Latvia. A structural equation modelling technique was used to analyse the relationships between variables of the model and test the nine hypothesis defined. Findings: Six constructs have been identified to facilitate significant relationships with behavioural intention. The analysis of the results of the three countries allows us to draw more objective conclusions in respect to the aim of the study and to reveal country-specific aspects that need to be addressed in the future. Originality/value: This study adds to the existing literature few theoretical and practical aspects. It highlights the role of open data portals as a central point of OGD infrastructures. It enables governments to understand the relationships among the related constructs, improving their actions and modifying their data infrastructures accordingly. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The U.S. policy on critical infrastructure protection has been continually evolving since the “President’s Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection” was published in 1997. In response to these policies, federal, state, and local governments, along with research institutions, have invested a substantial amount of time and effort into identifying and analyzing critical infrastructure, their functions, and dependencies/interdependencies to better understand their vulnerabilities. To date, the ability to assess vulnerabilities, resiliency, and priorities for protecting interdependent critical infrastructure systems from an all-hazards perspective remains a difficult problem. In this paper we introduce the All-Hazards Analysis (AHA) methodology, which provides an integrated functional basis across infrastructure systems, through the implementation of a common language and a scalable level of decomposition to effectively evaluate the resilience of interconnected infrastructure systems. AHA models infrastructure systems as directed multidimensional graphs, which enable the evaluation of cross-sector interdependencies prior to, during, and after disruptive events. Finally, and by design, AHA enables the cross linking of data taxonomies to enable more effective data sharing, such as the National Critical Functions (NCF) and Infrastructure Data Taxonomy (IDT). © 2021, Policy Studies Organization.

Design/methodology/approach: The developed methodology consisted of a two-step strategy to investigate research questions. First, a web content analysis was conducted to identify the most common features and capabilities provided by existing national open data portals. The second step involved performing the Delphi process by surveying domain experts to measure the diversity of their opinions on this topic. Findings: Identified features and capabilities were classified into categories and ranked according to their importance. By formalizing these feature-related transparency mechanisms through which stakeholders work with data sets we provided recommendations on how to incorporate them into designing and developing open data portals. Social implications: The creation of appropriate open data portals aims to fulfil the principles of open government and enables stakeholders to effectively engage in the policy and decision-making processes.

Given this change, the need to develop digital strategies has emerged as crucial for the governments. These strategies involve multiple challenges such as the investment in infrastructure, the adaptation of the legal system, and the involvement of civil society; all of them require accessibility, training and security. This study aimed to assess Mercosur countries’ digital strategies, digital agendas and programs recently implemented to deal with the digitalization process and the digital asymmetries. The methodology was based on a literature review and analysis of quantitative secondary sources. The study concludes that, although there is a will to advance in this process given the approval of Digital Agendas by the Mercosur´s member States, it is still necessary to implement measures to reduce the digital asymmetries within the bloc and to take joint positions to avoid that these asymmetries negatively impact on intra-bloc trade and Mercosur’s international insertion. © 2023 Centro Universitario de Brasilia.

In Spain, there are very different models for monitoring transparency. From the public point of view, there is the Council for Transparency and Good Governance and several transparency commissioners set up in some autonomous communities. On the other hand, there are various transparency indexes that evaluate with indicators the information published by the institutions.

	abstract = {It examines the quantitative expansion of stricto sensu graduate studies in the area of education in Brazil, based on the student dimension of its programs, considering their regional differences, type of course, and legal status. The quantitative approach and the documentary research method composed the methodological design of the investigation. The sample consisted of the total number of students in the course, admitted students, and graduated students in Graduate Programs in Education (GPEs), from 2004 to 2020. The data sets referring to the students were collected in the open data repository of the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES, in Portuguese). Data analysis used descriptive statistics techniques, through the R language. There was an increase in the number of students in the courses, admitted students, and graduated students in GPEs in Brazil during the investigated period. The asymmetries, although still existing, were mitigated. The North and Northeast regions are still underrepresented. The participation of the private sector is still timid, if compared to the hegemony of the public sector, even when it comes to professional master’s degrees. In 2020 there was a decrease in all indicators, characterizing an inflection in the expansion process. These results are likely to contribute to support decision-making by managers and public policy makers. © (2023), (Emerson de Pietri). All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {As COVID-19 swept over the world, people discussed facts, expressed opinions, and shared sentiments about the pandemic on social media. Since policies such as travel restriction and lockdown in reaction to COVID-19 were made at different levels of the society (e.g., schools and employers) and the government, we build a large geo-tagged Twitter dataset titled UsaGeoCov19 and perform an exploratory analysis by geographic location. Specifically, we collect 650,563 unique geo-tagged tweets across the United States covering the date range from January 25 to May 10, 2020. Tweet locations enable us to conduct region-specific studies such as tweeting volumes and sentiment, sometimes in response to local regulations and reported COVID-19 cases. During this period, many people started working from home. The gap between workdays and weekends in hourly tweet volumes inspire us to propose algorithms to estimate work engagement during the COVID-19 crisis. This paper also summarizes themes and topics of tweets in our dataset using both social media exclusive tools (i.e., \#hashtags, @mentions) and the latent Dirichlet allocation model. We welcome requests for data sharing and conversations for more insights. UsaGeoCov19 link: http://yunhefeng.me/geo-tagged\_twitter\_datasets/. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The modern development of globalization trends determines the need for systems for monitoring and analyzing the development of e-governance in regions. The purpose of the article is to assess the level of development of e-governance of the regions of Ukraine in order to determine digital opportunities and prospects for the introduction of the latest information technologies. The information base for the evaluation of e-governance of the regions of Ukraine is: the data of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine and the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine; the data of regional and district state administrations; and reference and information publications of the Ukrainian Institute of the Future and the Innovation Development Center regarding the state of development of e-governance. On the basis of the taxonometric approach, a comparative assessment of e-governance of the regions of Ukraine was carried out according to certain indicators: the share of internet subscribers by region in the total number of subscribers in Ukraine; the level of development of local electronic democracy; the share of state authorities that use e-democracy tools in the region in the total number of state administration bodies; the number of registered e-applications; the share of "Participation budget (public budget)"projects submitted by the public of the region in the total number of submitted projects; the level of publicity of local self-government; the share of electronic services provided in the TsNAP of the region per day in the total number of services provided; and the share of published reports in the region based on the results of the implementation of the open data policy in the total number of published reports. According to the results of the assessment of the level of development of e-government in the regions using the taxonometric method, the leading regions (the Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Lviv, Odesa, and Ivano-Frankivsk regions) and the regions with the lowest level of development of e-government (the Luhansk and Cherkasy regions) were determined. The main prospects for the implementation of the latest information technologies in the regions were also determined: the creation of digital platforms; the introduction of innovative technologies into the management system based on the smart city concept; the development of IT infrastructure; the increase of institutional capacity; and the implementation of digital development projects and open data. © 2022 Uspekhi Khimii, ZIOC RAS, Russian Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Rapid technological progress and its concomitant need for new skills, ways of working and collaborating, paired with dynamic socio-economic change, have highlighted the main challenge facing Europe's urban municipalities. Being the part of the public sector closest to citizens and their needs, the challenge addresses digital transformation's goals to support and promote broader growth in the digital domain optimally and to realise digital transformation benefits such as user-friendly and citizen-centred services, increased quality of life and better business environments. Urban municipalities must identify local strengths, priorities and needs, including performance and digital maturity assessment, and define strategic goals and implementation roadmaps to implement digital transformation optimally. Furthermore, they must increase city administration, decision-maker and citizens awareness of the opportunities and benefits digitally enabled solutions offer. A comprehensive digital maturity self-Assessment is the first step towards successful digital transformation. An example of a framework for such an assessment is the framework of the European Commission's Intelligent Cities Challenge (ICC), the EU's bespoke support programme for coaching, facilitation and inspiration, and successor to its Digital Cities Challenge. Therefore, the objective of our research was to analyse the digital maturity self-Assessment results undertaken by eleven Slovenian urban municipalities utilising ICC's assessment methodology framework for government services and social connectivity, which includes indicators sets of digitising public services, digital connectivity and open data. We further focused on the potential impact of municipality population size on its digital maturity. According to the existing research, this is one of the significant potential explanatory factors why municipalities differ in terms of digital transformation implementation and adaptation. One would a priori expect larger municipalities to be digitally more mature than smaller ones because they have more resources at their disposal, however, our results prove that this is not the complete picture. There is, however, a relationship between municipality population size and digital maturity, including indicators of open data sharing and security, but not entirely in the manner expected. Furthermore, our analysis has shown that municipality population size does not influence overall digital maturity but individual digital maturity indicators, highlighting the need to develop more detailed and accurate individual digital maturity indicators. Although the influence of municipality population size on overall digital maturity could not be demonstrated, its partial influence on individual sets is essential when endeavouring to achieve efficient digital transformation. © 2022 Arian Debeljak et al., published by Sciendo.},

Likewise, cities are interested in improving responsiveness to citizens’ demands and cost savings through data analytics. However, city managers face many challenges when utilizing secondary data, such as 311 call records and the US Census. The challenge of interest to the current study is boundary issues as a result of data being collected at divergent geographic levels over different time horizons. Accordingly, an inductive analytical methodology was developed to create units of analysis that were both pragmatically and analytically appropriate for city managers and local policymakers. We created an open data analytics framework called OpenComm to harmonize administrative and secondary data using administrative data derived from Kansas City, Missouri. This framework produced robust inferences regarding the spatial and temporal aspects for the communities. Privacy-preserving technology, in particular, has been applied to public data to protect community privacy. The findings illustrate the power of inductive data aggregation, leading to empirical insights into hidden patterns of city service disparity over a decade-long time horizon.

	abstract = {The regularity and demand predictions of shared cycling are very necessary and challenging for the management and development of urban pedestrian and bicycle traffic. The bicycle-sharing system has the problem of spatial and temporal demand fluctuations and presents a very complex nonlinear regularity. The demand for shared bicycles is affected by many factors, including time, space, weather and the situation of COVID-19. This study proposes a new bicycle-sharing demand forecasting model (USTARN) based on the impact of COVID-19, which combines urban computing and spatiotemporal attention residual network. USTARN consists of two parts. In the first part, a spatiotemporal attention residual network model is established to learn the temporal correlation and spatial correlation of shared bicycle demand. The temporal characteristic branches of each spatial small region are trained, respectively, to predict the shared bicycle demand in batches in different regions and periods according to the historical data. In order to improve the prediction accuracy of the model, the second part of the model adjusts and redistributes the prediction results of the first part by learning other information of the city, such as the severity of COVID-19, weather, temperature, wind speed and holidays. It can predict the demand for shared bicycles in different urban areas in different periods and different severities of COVID-19. This study uses the order data of shared bicycles during the period of COVID-19 in 2020 obtained from the open data platform of Shenzhen municipal government as verification, analyzes the spatiotemporal regularity of the system demand and discusses the impact of the number of newly diagnosed patients and the daily minimum temperature on the demand for shared bicycles. The results show that USTARN can fully reflect time, space, the epidemic situation, weather and temperature, and the prediction results of the impact of wind speed and other factors on the demand for shared bicycles are better than the classical methods. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The modern highly globalised economy is jeopardising human health as the increased mobility and interconnectedness has the potential to rapidly transmit pathogens across the globe. This was recently confirmed by the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, which quickly led to localised outbreaks in virtually every country. As the existing health systems were unprepared, the world has witnessed a critical shortage of life-supporting and health-sustaining resources. In the absence of effective non-pharmaceutical interventions to suppress the virus transmission, many governments imposed total or partial lockdowns, with devastating economic consequences. The case of Hong Kong in quickly suppressing the virus from spreading can thus be a lesson for all. In this study, open data sources of infected individuals are employed to compile maps of disease incidents at various geographic scales with the aim of better understanding the transmission dynamics and discern spatial variability. Our findings show that tracking human mobility patterns can improve awareness of spatiotemporal factors driving the risks of human exposure to viruses. Moreover, we have demonstrated that spatial tools can be successfully employed to explore connections between individuals and wider communities with the aim of informing adaptation of policies at different spatial scales and for different time periods. As was shown in the case of Hong Kong, disease control encompasses the interrelated tasks of reducing social interactions and encouraging adoption of protective behaviours.},

	abstract = {In recent years, research funding agencies, universities, and governments have become increasingly concerned with promoting the reuse of research datasets. Enabling researchers to evaluate the trustworthiness and fitness-for-use of research datasets produced by others is critical for facilitating the reuse of these datasets. Understanding how researchers make these evaluations is crucial for developing digital infrastructure and tools, such as data repositories and metadata schema, in a way that better supports researchers in making these evaluations. Physical samples such as rocks are critical for generating datasets in many scientific domains. Often, samples are collected on field expeditions conducted by large infrastructural projects. These projects comprise many human and non-human components that affect the quality and integrity of samples. However, little is known about whether and how prospective dataset users evaluate the samples' trustworthiness and sample collection processes underlying these datasets. Researchers‘strategies for evaluating sample trustworthiness are explored through a longitudinal qualitative case study (ethnographic observation, interviews (n = 66), and document analysis) of subseafloor biosphere research, an earth sciences domain. Domain researchers use rock samples collected on research cruises conducted by the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). Subseafloor biosphere researchers are primarily concerned about samples being compromised by microbiological contamination. Researchers vary regarding the components of IODP infrastructure they consider when evaluating sample trustworthiness. These components include methods to process samples, people handling samples, IODP policies and procedures, and IODP organizational politics. Researchers‘strategies vary according to their disciplinary background, with microbiologists employing more fine-grained judgments about methods; whether researchers have participated in IODP expeditions, with those who have employing more fine-grained judgments about people involved; and whether researchers have ever been involved in organizing cruises or serving on IODP committees, with those who have employing more fine-grained judgments about many aspects of cruises. Researchers who make less complex decisions may be prone to erroneously trusting contaminated samples; researchers who make more complex decisions may be prone to erroneously discarding uncontaminated samples. The paper concludes by considering implications for the design of digital infrastructures to support researchers in evaluating sample trustworthiness. Copyright © 2022 Darch.},

Though current government initiatives have substantial potential for coproduction, the practical adoption and implementation of such practices vary reflecting the purposes, contexts, and motivations of those involved. This paper aims to understand how local governments are following different approaches to coproduce information with citizens and what motivates local governments in this process. We report findings based on interviews with 11 cities from the USA and Canada, which reveal four main approaches: The collection of new data, observation of changes, collection of opinions, and observation of preferences involving both explicit and implicit processes. Although these four approaches result from interactions between citizens and government, our findings also indicate a key role to be played by technology and partner organizations. © 2021, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

	abstract = {Background: The Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance (the Alliance) is a collaboration of leading hospitals, research and academic organisations, supported by its member organisations and the Victorian Government. The Alliance was set up by its members in 2013 to steer the translation of genomics, making it an integral part of health care in Victoria, Australia. The Community Advisory Group (CAG) was formed soon after, to give input and advice across the program. This was to ensure consideration of community values, perspectives and priorities, and knowledge translation for patient care. The CAG was charged with providing a strong community voice for the duration of the program. Appointed members were experienced consumer advocates with developed connections to the community. Main body: The Alliance progressed from an initial Demonstration Project (2013–2015) to a multifaceted program (2016–2020). The CAG worked strategically to help address complex issues, for example, communication, privacy, informed consent, ethics, patient experience, measurement and evaluation standards and policies, data storage and re-use of genomic data. Many aspects of translating genomics into routine care have been tackled, such as communicating with patients invited to have genomic testing, or their caregivers, and obtaining informed consent, clinical questions across 16 areas of health care, training and education of health and laboratory professionals, genomic data management and data-sharing. Evidence generated around clinical utility and cost-effectiveness led to government funding of testing for complex genetic conditions in children. Conclusion: The CAG activities, recorded in a CAG-inspired Activity register, span the full spectrum of information sharing and consultation to co-design and partnership. The CAG were involved at multiple levels of participation and in all tiers of activity including governance, development of policies and procedures, program planning and evaluation. Working relationships were built up and a level of trust instilled to advance the Alliance work program in ensuring an effective patient-care model of delivery of genomics. CAG input into project deliverables has been tangible. Less tangible contributions included presentations at external meetings and conferences, direct interactions at meetings with Alliance members, interactions with visitors and external experts, taking part in consultations with experts, state and federal government. © 2021, The Author(s).},

As a result, local communities have taken matters into their own hands and turned to technology platforms to coordinate mutual aid efforts, shed light on response gaps, and hold governments accountable. This paper explores the role of open data sharing platforms and collective intelligence in COVID-19 response efforts by studying two examples of community-led initiatives from Spain and Japan. Frena La Curva (Spain) and Safecast (Japan) utilized the Ushahidi platform, an open-source technology tool born out of Kenya’s post-election violence that has been widely used in over 160 countries for crisis response since its inception in 2008. Research reports have been warning of pandemic breakouts for decades. However, the response to COVID-19 was inadequate, with healthcare systems buckling under the pressure of the spread of the disease. Moreover, existing social protection programs could not shield citizens despite having experienced similar economic impacts in the years that have passed. Data hugging and suppression of information regarding the pandemic outbreak led to significant delays in measures being put in place to curb the spread of COVID-19. This paper proposes that governments would benefit from leveraging open data and technology platforms to engage with ordinary citizens and eliminate data blind spots in the design of social protection programs. It also posits that we need to invest in interoperable data exchange systems to increase the speed of response and learning. Finally, it also proposes the need for internet freedom and access as a critical tool for preparedness by enabling the free flow of information. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {Research and development are critical for driving economic growth. To realise the UK government’s Industrial Strategy, we develop an energy research and innovation infrastructure roadmap and landscape for the energy sector looking to the long term (2030). This study is based on a picture of existing UK infrastructure on energy. It shows the links between the energy sector and other sectors, the distribution of energy research and innovation infrastructures, the age of these infrastructures, where most of the energy research and innovation infrastructures are hosted, and the distribution of energy research and innovation infrastructures according to their legal structure. Next, this study identifies the roadmap of energy research and innovation infrastructures by 2030, based on a categorisation of the energy sector into seven subsectors. Challenges and future require-ments are explored for each of the sub-sectors, encompassing fossil fuels and nuclear energy to renewable energy sources and hydrogen, and from pure science to applied engineering. The study discusses the potential facilities to address these challenges within each sub-sector. It explores the e-infrastructure and data needs for the energy sector and provides a discussion on other sectors of the economy that energy research and innovation infrastructures contribute to. Some of the key messages identified in this study are the need for further large-scale initiative and large demonstrators of multi-vector energy systems, the need for multi-disciplinary research and innovation, and the need for greater data sharing and cyber-physical demonstrators. Finally, this work will serve as an important study to provide guidance for future investment strategy for the energy sector. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

By combining data sources, data virtualisation can help overcome technical and regulatory challenges, and create new value. The topic was approached from three perspectives: the exploitation of city data, the potential for data virtualisation to utilise city data, and the detection of gaps for future use of city data. Finnish cities are interested in utilisation of the rich data they have within the city and new data that is gathered by different actors. However, there is a gap between the potential and the current situation. When city data is generated continuously from different functions, the scattered data storages can be utilised efficiently with data virtualisation. The city itself, commercial operators, governments and individuals all benefit about the deeper understanding of city functions. Sharing data from different systems and sectors creates opportunities for measuring also other but financial benefits. In the case of city bicycles studied in the city of Kuopio, expanded usage of the bicycles was seen as benefiting citizens' wellbeing and health. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {In Europe, an open government data ecosystem is being developed. This ecosystem is implemented using various technologies and platforms. In fact, the use of a common metadata standard for describing datasets and open data portals, i.e., the DCAT-AP specification, appears as the lingua franca that connects an, otherwise, fragmented environment. In this context, the standard-based consolidation of open data promotes the subsidiarity principle, allowing open data portal owners to choose platforms and internal representations based on their specific requirements. However, the portal owners must provide an export with DCAT-AP compliant metadata about the dataset they store. In this paper we provide a detailed study of how the DCAT-AP specification is used in practice, both at the national and the European level. Consequently, we also identify issues, challenges, and opportunities for improvements that can be used as input for the next revision cycle of the standard. Essentially, our goal is to contribute towards the enrichment of a growing and promising European open data ecosystem. Copyright © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {Under the background of big data, citizens can freely access and use open data to create value through the open government data platform (OGDP). The sustainable use of OGDP can meet the needs of citizens. The value created by citizens can also improve quality of life, which is of great significance to the sustainable development of society. From the citizens’ perspective, we constructed an evaluation model of citizens’ sustainable use of OGDP, including 12 indicators in four dimensions: Data, platform, outcome, and citizen. We have built the complete evaluation system with the DANP (Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory-Based Analytic Network Process) method. It explores the main influencing factors and mutual influence of citizens’ sustainable use of OGDP. Empirical research is done on four provincial OGDPs in China’s Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guizhou, and Fujian provinces. The TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) method was used to rank the OGDPs in four pilot areas in empirical research. The results demonstrate that the improvement priorities of dimensions have the following order: Citizen, outcome, data, and platform, in which data and platform are cause dimensions, and outcome and citizen are result dimensions. The satisfaction indicator has the highest weight among all evaluation indicators, followed by the quality and quantity of outcomes. The one with the lowest weight is non-discrimination. The empirical results show that the OGDP in Zhejiang ranks the highest overall, followed by the OGDPs of Shanghai, Fujian, and Guizhou provinces. In the outcome and citizen dimensions, Zhejiang provincial OGDP does the best. Fujian provincial OGDP does the best in the platform dimension. The citizens’ sustainable use of OGDP can be promoted by timely opening of data that citizens need urgently, perfecting the policy of privacy protection and user guide of OGDP, holding open data innovation competition, providing data visualization function, providing various download formats of data sets, and simplifying the download procedures for citizens. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, we address the existing initiatives regarding data and government transparency evaluation as two separate indicators and present the analysis of their advantages and drawbacks. Based on that analysis, we extend a part of the OpenGovB benchmark related to transparency in open government. What is unique about this benchmark is that it utilizes metadata of data published on the open government data portals to calculate the majority of indicators related to data transparency indicators. For the government transparency indicator evaluation, the benchmark utilizes some of the well-known transparency indi-cators. The article shows concrete results obtained from the application of the defined transparency evaluation model on 22 open data portals, thus demonstrating the possibilities of its application as well as the gains regarding generated results. The proposed model bridges the gap between available methodologies for evaluating transparency based on collaboration and participation and methodologies for evaluating transparency based on open data. © 2022 by the authors.

The use of Open Government Data (OGD) has spread globally as governments make more of their data available via electronically accessible formats for individuals to use and share. OGD is seen as something that has the potential to play an important role in achieving transparency, and accountability, enabling new forms of civic participation, and stimulates economic growth and development. However, there is a need to examine OGD datasets to determine whether they are truly open. The purpose of this paper is to investigate OGD openness based on a number of existing or proposed open data definitions and principles. The principles proposed by the work of the Open Government Working Group will be analyzed. The methodology that has been used to collect the data includes OGD website content analysis, participant observation and semi-structured interviews using purposeful and snowball sampling techniques. The results in this paper are just part of the overall study. This research has not been funded. The research limitation is that it has been done only in the Irish context. It is an original study with primary data. The conclusion of this research mainly demonstrates that OGD in the Irish context is progressing but requires further work to be open based on the principles proposed by the Open Government Working Group works. © 2022 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

It focuses on public officers in 261 Korean public agencies. In order to verify the research model’s hypotheses, we take advantage of Structural Equation Modeling and the Technology Acceptance Model. As a first result, concerning the direct effect on GaaP, the quality of open data, the scope of the stakeholders, and attitudes to civic engagement have a positive relationship on the perceived usefulness of Intelligent Information Technology (IIT). Second, in terms of the effect of IIT on GaaP, the perceived usefulness of IIT mediates positively on the intention to adopt GaaP based on the quality of open data, the scope of the stakeholders, and attitudes towards civic engagement. Based on these results, policy implications can be described as follows. Besides managing internal open data, governments should actively mine new open data that can create added value for innovation. They need to create an easily cooperative environment with other stakeholders, especially non-public participants, and governments should encourage public officers to more actively accept and utilize IIT in their jobs. © 2021 by the authors.

These so-called ‘data collaboratives’ are seen as a novel way of leveraging different sources of data and expertise for societal impact. Data collaboratives come with new challenges that might require new governance structures and processes. So far, scant attention has been paid in the literature to data collaborative governance. This study aims to fill that gap. Building upon the collaborative governance and information sharing literature, a framework for Data Collaborative Governance is developed. This framework was tested in a living lab that focused on the public problem of anti-social behavior. Empirical data was collected over a period of one and a half years and analyzed based on an abductive research approach. The findings show that data sharing adds new elements to collaborative governance theory and practice. This study also demonstrates that a living lab is a promising methodology for studying data collaboratives. Finally, it shows that working across boundaries of organizations and sharing data to address complex problems in more collaborative ways has the potential to generate insights for complex public problems. © 2021 The Author(s)},

The pairwise distribution patterns of the horizontal axis (XY axis) were investigated using the nearest-neighbour spatial association measure. The forest inclusion rates were also analysed using forested area polygons, while the slope angles and altitudes (Z axis) for each feature were analysed using a digital elevation model. As a result, haunted sites showed significant adjoint trends with medical and penal facilities and showed a tendency to approximate water facilities in terms of altitude analyses. This finding was consistent with the results of our previous study, which showed that haunted sites do not show an associated trend with any of the other public facilities other than medical facilities.

However, not all data of interest to society are currently published in open formats. This study verifies whether the data referring to the Federal Institutes of Education, Science and Technology, which are commonly requested from the Office of the Comptroller General by civil society, are being cataloged in the Brazilian Open Data Portal. Method: Quantitative research was conducted on the Brazilian Open Data Portal with the support of the documentary research technique, which allowed us to analyze the datasets published by the Federal Institutes. An index was created to analyze each of the 14 collected themes, which originated a quantitative indicator used to compare the results of each Federal Institute involved in the research. Results: It was identified that 73.70\% of the Federal Institutes cataloged at least one dataset on the Brazilian Open Data Portal. However, there were strikingly several gaps in the availability of open data by these institutions, in addition to the low adherence to opening data in accordance with the recommendations of the Office of the Comptroller General. Conclusions: Studies such as the one carried out in this paper contribute to the Public Administration, especially considering the context of Federal Institutes, to have subsidies that indicate points for improvement with regard to society’s demands on transparency and governance. © 2022 Marques, Bax, Lopes Júnior, Souza \& Melo.},

	abstract = {This article assesses how compatible Russia’s legal regime for digital data is with the implementation of international standards and best practices. Data is a key resource for developing a digital economy, and therefore the conditions provided for access to data and data sharing become factors in the well-being of an information society and in the qualitative development of competitive digital markets. As an illustration of the applicable international standards, the article provides legal analysis of the OECD Recommendation on Enhancing Access to and Sharing of Data from 2021, which is concerned primarily with ensuring the trustworthiness of the data ecosystem; and the essential element for that is a reliable legal regime protecting data. Governments should therefore provide balanced measures for facilitating both access to and sharing of data in order to allow more freedom for data to circulate while maintaining the legal guarantees of the data regimes. As an illustration of the best international regulatory practices, the article analyzes the recently adopted EU Data Governance Act, which addresses three main topics: the reuse of protected data in the public sector, the configuration of providers of data sharing services, and the introduction of what is termed data altruism. The authors examine the main gaps and shortcomings in Russian legislation pertaining to personal data in order to identify ways in which implementation of international standards and practices might be hindered. The article concludes with the authors’ argument that amendments to Federal Law No. 152 “On Personal Data” are necessary to improve the ability of personal data subjects to manage their data, as this is an essential condition for the development of a trustworthy data ecosystem in Russia. © 2022, Ekonomicheskaya Politika.

	abstract = {The cadastre is the base of a country's territorial administration system, it contains the register of different interests on the national space, it describes the properties geometrically, interoperating with other registries. It usually covers the continental territory and remains within the legal maritime limit, however, companies and governments need information regarding rights, restrictions and responsibilities also in the marine environment and in its coastal zone. In South America, the administration of these interests has not yet been unified or standardized, much less registered in a geographic information system. In this context, the objective of this study is to contribute to a Marine Cadastre modeling and to develop a prototype of a Marine Information System for its implementation, prior to the availability of a marine spatial data infrastructure. The system was developed under a structure that responds to the needs to systematize information for this type of registration by connecting thematic data to a graphic output to view open data in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. It guarantees interoperability based on the establishment of common standards and could be responsible for the registration and monitoring activities of the marine environment. It was built in JavaScript language (JS), with specific open source libraries for Web Maps, among which are TurfJS, LeafletJS and some specific plugins. The results of this work provide guidelines to establish a relevant legal framework with regard to the design of the institutional structure responsible for a Marine Cadastre under international standards. © RCN Publishing Company Limited 2021.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in technology have made truly open and accessible government significantly more realisable. One of the ways in which governments are using this technology is in the implementation of online portals that allow open (i.e., public and unrestricted) access to data and use of data. Such portals can be used by citizens and professionals to facilitate improved decision-making across a wide range of areas, from car-parking to promoting entrepreneurialism. However, the existence of portals per se is not enough. To maximise their potential, users must also feel that they are both accessible and usable. To gain insights into the current state of usability of OGD portals for professionals working in data-related areas, a comparative study of the portals of the G7 group was carried out, using a mixed methodology. This is the first specific comparison of these portals for such users, as well as the first study to add a user-centred qualitative dimension to the research. The study’s findings showed that the G7 countries are not maximising the potential of their portals or collaborating effectively. Addressing these issues, and building better cross-national consistency, would help to improve the value delivered by investment in OGD portals. The study also further supported an existing user-centred, heuristic evaluation framework for application to a more specific user group, as well as more generally. © 2021 by the authors.

However, progress has been significantly less than either hoped for or expected. The purpose of this research is to explore the reasons for this lack of progress. To do so, the attitudes and views of a range of senior government department (OGD-related) personnel were sought, using semi-structured interviews, and the results examined using thematic analysis. Unlike existing studies, which focus on external barriers to progress, this study focuses on internal factors which can result in a lack of progress to implementation, such as leadership attitudes, organisational culture and fear of failure. The findings show that considerable changes are required at both an ideological and practical level, if the gap between expectation and reality is to be closed. The paper concludes with recommendations of specific actions that can be taken to close this gap and the identification of areas where further study would be useful. © 2022 by the authors.

This research presents a smart solution, capable of identifying the profile of potential tax evaders, using only open and public data, made available by the Brazilian internal revenue service, the administrative council of tax appeals of the State of Goiás, and other public sources. Three models were generated using Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Graphs. The validation after fine improvements offered an accuracy greater than 98\% in predicting tax evading companies.

	abstract = {Under pressure to fight corruption, hold public officials accountable, and build trust with citizens, many governments pursue the quest for greater transparency. They publish data about their internal operations, externalize decision-making processes, establish digital inquiry lines to public officials, and employ other forms of transparency using digital means. Despite the presence of many transparency-enhancing digital tools, putting such tools together to achieve the desired level of digital transparency, to design entire government systems for digital transparency, remains challenging. Design principles and other design guides are lacking in this area. This article aims to fill this gap. We identify a set of barriers to digital transparency in government, define 16 design principles to overcome such barriers, and evaluate these principles using three case studies from different countries. Some principles apply to projects, others to systems, yet others to entire organizations. To achieve digital transparency, before building and deploying digital solutions, government organizations should build technological and institutional foundations and use such foundations to organize themselves for transparency. The proposed design principles can help develop and apply such foundations. © 2020 The Author(s)},

The outcome of the investigation shows that the disclosure levels are unsatisfactory overall and, although they have improved lately, they are only relevant for global transparency thanks to the development and contribution of the transparency portals, which overshadow the usefulness of the institutional web site.

Furthermore, it is unclear what categories of barriers are most obstructive for attaining open data objectives. This paper aims to categorize and prioritize barriers for openly sharing and using government data based on many existing Open Government Data Initiatives (OGDIs). Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzes 171 survey responses concerning existing OGDIs worldwide. Findings: The authors found that the most critical OGDI barrier categories concern (in order of most to least critical): functionality and support; inclusiveness; economy, policy and process; data interpretation; data quality and resources; legislation and access; and sustainability. Policymakers should prioritize solving functionality and support barriers and inclusiveness barriers because the authors found that these are the most obstructive in attaining OGDI objectives. Practical implications: The prioritization of open data barriers calls for three main actions by practitioners to reduce the barrier impact: open data portal developers should develop advanced tools to support data search, analysis, visualization, interpretation and interaction; open data experts and teachers should train potential users, and especially those currently excluded from OGDIs because of a lack of digital skills; and government agencies that provide open data should put user-centered design and the user experience central to better support open data users. Originality/value: This study contributes to the open data literature by proposing a new, empirically based barrier categorization and prioritization based a large number of existing OGDIs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In this paper, a comprehensive model of determinants that enable or impede transparency enabled by open government data and the expected effects have been derived by surveying public administration and information systems literature. Public administration literature tends to be focused on factors such as participation and trust, whereas information systems literature focuses on factors such as user interface, user experience, and data quality. Digital government literature attempts to bridge these elements. The Window Theory is introduced, in order to unify existing models by integrating a broad range of factors within a single model. The Window Theory can be used to develop context-dependent models that are both comprehensive and parsimonious. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s). Pulished with license by Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this exploratory study is to provide modern local governments with potential use cases for their open data, in order to help inform related future policies and decision-making. The concrete context was that of the Växjö municipality located in southeastern Sweden. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology was two-fold: 1) a survey of potential end users (n=151) from a local university; and, 2) analysis of survey results using a theoretical model regarding local strategies for implementing open government data. Findings: Most datasets predicted to be useful were on: sustainability and environment; preschool and school; municipality and politics. The use context given is primarily research and development, informing policies and decision making; but also education, informing personal choices, informing citizens and creating services based on open data. Not the least, the need for educating target user groups on data literacy emerged. A tentative pattern comprising a technical perspective on open data and a social perspective on open government was identified. Research limitations: In line with available funding, the nature of the study was exploratory and implemented as an anonymous web-based survey of employees and students at the local university. Further research involving (qualitative) surveys with all stakeholders would allow for creating a more complete picture of the matter. Practical implications: The study determines potential use cases and use contexts for open government data, in order to help inform related future policies and decision-making. Originality/value: Modern local governments, and especially in Sweden, are faced with a challenge of how to make their data open, how to learn about which types of data will be most relevant for their end users and what will be different societal purposes. The paper contributes to knowledge that modern local governments can resort to when it comes to attitudes of local citizens to open government data in the context of an open government data perspective. © 2021 Sciendo.

	abstract = {The citizen science approach has gained momentum in recent years. It can enable both experts and citizen scientists to co-create new knowledge. Better understanding of local environmental, social, and geographical contexts can help in designing appropriate plans for sustainable development. However, a lack of geospatial data, especially in the context of developing countries, often precludes context-specific development planning. This study therefore tests an innovative approach of volunteer citizen science and an open mapping platform to build resilience to natural hazards in the remote mountainous parts of western Nepal. In this study, citizen scientists and mapping experts jointly mapped two districts of Nepal (Bajhang and Bajura) using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) platform. Remote mapping based on satellite imagery, capacity building, and mobilization of citizen scientists was performed to collect the data. These data were then uploaded to OSM and later retrieved in ArcGIS to produce a usable map that could be exploited as a reference resource for evidence-based decision-making. The collected data are freely accessible to community members as well as government and humanitarian actors, and can be used for development planning and risk reduction. By piloting in two communities of western Nepal, we found that using open data platforms for collecting and analyzing location-based data has a mutual benefit for researchers and communities. Such data could be vital in understanding the local landscape, environmental risk, and distribution of resources. Furthermore, they enable both researchers and local people to transfer technical knowledge, collect location-specific data, and use them for better decision-making. © 2020 by the authors.

In the literature, there is a lack of scientific research of a theoretical and practical nature that presents more updated scenarios regarding initiatives to open government data, mainly in actions to organize information in this segment, both in Brazil and abroad. This article aims to present the background and historical movement of data opening, in addition to the current panorama of initiatives in some continental countries, showing relevant stages and contributions to the discussions on challenges and opportunities for their governments. Method: It is qualitative, exploratory and descriptive research using bibliographic and documentary research techniques for a systematic review of government open data scenarios both in Brazil and in other international spheres. Results: The theoretical and methodological contributions of Information and Computer Sciences are highlighted in the main challenges mapped in the research, in addition to the decline of nations such as the USA and the United Kingdom, former leaders of the movement, and the rise of new protagonists, such as Korea South, France, Ireland and Spain, also presenting the current Brazilian scenario. Conclusion: The article shows that one of the main successes in data opening concerns the way governments are dealing with Government Open Data Policy and those internal aspects of governance are affecting the publication of data on the network, according to the precepts of the open movement recommended in the literature. © 2021 Macedo \& Lemos.},

However, extant research highlights a need for improved feedback loops, collaboration, and a more demand-driven publication of OGD. In this study, we explore how public platform providers can address this issue by enabling collaboration within OGD ecosystems, both in terms of the OGD, and any related Open Source Software (OSS) and standards. We conducted an exploratory multiple-case study of four OGD ecosystems with diverse characteristics, using a qualitative research approach. Based on the cases, we present a conceptual model that highlights different attributes of OGD ecosystems that may help public entities in designing and orchestrating new or existing OGD ecosystems. We conclude that enabling collaboration in an OGD ecosystem is a complex exercise yet believe that it offers ways for public entities in how they can leverage open innovation to address their goals and directives. © 2021, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

Analyzing smart city initiatives in Iran as case studies, the theoretical framework we present reflects on how cities explore the possibility of becoming smart, and prepare themselves to begin implementing the transition towards becoming a smart city. This theoretical framework is then applied to four Iranian cities aspiring to become smart and that already possess credible smart city brands. The findings reveal that the most significant difficulty in Iran is associated with the political context. The changing urban governance model is the most important factor in Iranian smart cities’ readiness. Utilization of open data policies and data sharing, as well as making reforms in government structures are all considered a sine qua non to gain momentum. Based on the results of our empirical analysis a Theory of Change is developed to address the cities’ technological, socio-economic, and political readiness vis-à-vis the desired transition. The framework for measuring smart city readiness and the Theory of Change provide practical guidelines to developing systematic roadmaps for developing and implementing smart city policies. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Due to the wide-ranging development of data-oriented sustainable systems in the government and the public sectors, the development of such sustainable systems is replete with potential. The ultimate focus of developing these sustainable systems is to provide citizens with transparency, accountability, awareness as well as a single point of query for asking integrated and smart queries. In view of these benefits, the Saudi government has taken the initiative to publish and develop sustainable open data-oriented information systems. However some major challenges in the Saudi Government Open Data are that the (1) data are published and available in different formats such as Excel sheets, CSV files (Comma Separated Values), images, scanned documents and social media sources such as Twitter, (2) datasets from different government departments are not linked with each other or to existing datasets in Linked Open Data Cloud (even though they have strong links with each other), and (3) there is no SPARQL Endpoint that can be used to pose smart semantic-based queries to Saudi Government Data. This paper is part of an ongoing research project to present a framework that can be used to transfer the government data from different sources to RDF format. The framework can also be used to clean and classify/map the data according to the Saudi Government Ontology. We also describe our approach for semiautomatically linking Saudi Government Datasets with one another as well as with other existing open datasets, thus resulting in the Saudi Linked Open Government Data Cloud (SLOGDC). Finally, taking the topic “Public’s Response to Women’s Driving in Saudi Arabia” as a case study, we demonstrate the SLOGD SPARQL Endpoint as a data-oriented system by executing different queries and analyzing results of these queries. This work also contributes new insights into women’s driving in Saudi Arabia using the SLOGDC, thus suggesting the way forward in shaping policies for decision-making. © 2020 by the authors.

The datasets are an example of gathering databases that aim to be successful by standing as catalogs from the point of view of citizens, expanding the visibility of and on actions of public management. The objective is to describe the adherence to the use of metadata in datasets of governments of countries, based on the context and conceptual framework presented in the instructions for publishers of data found in open data sites of the countries analyzed. It is a descriptive investigation, focused on the critical observation of documents that address the descriptive treatment of government datasets. The bibliographic and documentary review and the definition of case studies in Colombia, Brazil, Spain, and Portugal are used as procedures. It was possible to determine the zeal of the data retainers by preferentially addressing the category metadata in use, thus giving greater importance to the practical aspect in relation to the theoretician, without disregarding the relevance of the theoretical instructions. In the content analysis, the instructions provided by the Government of Spain were observed as outstanding, where the effort to bring users closer to each other is guiding the publication of these documents; that country provided the largest number of documents available, the largest number of categories addressed, and the greatest intensity in the treatment given to each thematic component observed. It is suggested that governments implement plans aimed at improving their orientation to data publishers by providing both conceptual and practical tools, offering lengthy documents with theoretical and pragmatic components for the descriptive treatment of datasets. © 2021 Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecologia.

FD is an initiative of the Open Knowledge Foundation, which aims to eliminate "friction" in working with data, that is, when much time and resources are lost to understand and work with the data. Within public institutions, the lack of standards for publication and processing of DAGs is a common problem when it comes to opening DAGs. The study tried to contribute by applying the model to the set of data with information on good practices executed by the Judiciary related to the Objectives of Sustainable Development (ODS). Through a bibliographic survey, the main characteristics found in the models for opening DOGS and barriers inherent to the publication process, were identified in the literature. The laboratory research technique was used to describe and analyze the application of the proposed model in a controlled environment for specific purposes of this work. The model was based on Data Publication Workflow, a data publication flow available at the Frictionless Data initiative website that addresses steps such as data packaging, treatment and publication. The implementation of the model also used open source tools based on Frictionless Data. The results showed the feasibility of the model for opening up a set of open government data, as well as demonstrated that the tools available in the Frictionless Data initiative contributed to the verification of the steps in the model. It was concluded that the model needs validation in other contexts, such as integration and opening of different public databases related to ODS. © 2020 Universidade Estadual de Campinas.

	abstract = {Open data is a global movement with the potential to generate significant social and economic benefits. Policies on open government data (OGD) inspire the development of new and innovative services that government agencies may lack. The International Open Data Charter adequately describes the importance of data mining. Governments that have signed this charter should focus on the following areas—(i) data mining, (ii) linkage, and (iii) in-depth analysis, i.e., distribution of open data that is freely accessible for elaborate analysis using machine reading. However, a series of practical difficulties is observed in connection with the data mining of OGD for in-depth analysis. First, most OGD do not have identifiers to prevent privacy disclosure. Second, owing to the nature of siloed data, the data sharing and collection methods vary with respect to heterogeneous OGD, and administrative or institutional barriers need to be overcome. This has created a demand for a novel technical solution that applies micro-aggregation and distance-based record linkage to address the aforementioned issues. Thus, in this study, a method capable of integrating two or more de-identified OGDs into one dataset to enable OGD data mining is proposed. In addition, the proposed method allows users to adjust the privacy threshold level to determine an appropriate balance between privacy disclosure risk and data utility. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated in terms of several metrics via extensive experimentation. This study emphasizes the importance of the research on efficient utilization of already-published OGDs, which has been relatively neglected in the past. Further, it broadens the research area for privacy-preserving data mining by proposing a method capable of mining heterogeneous data even in the absence of identifiers. © 2020 The Author(s)},

Results show that the subject is multidisciplinary, and the main theme of study is how different agents reuse information released by public administrations to generate new entrepreneurial initiatives, especially novel business models associated with new mobile applications. Open data sources, innovation, and business models are studied as critical factors for analyzing entrepreneurship through open data. Likewise, a conceptual model is presented and emerging themes for future research are proposed. Among them, the importance of encouraging collaboration between different agents in the open data ecosystem for service development and improvement is emphasized.

Nevertheless, traditionally, conservation and restoration has been a poorly documented discipline, which has led not only to a lack of standardization and awareness about the processes carried out in the past, but also poses problems both when new restoration works are necessary and for the preventive conservation of the elements of heritage. This study sets out to propose a conceptual framework to explore the relationship between conservation of heritage and information management on the basis of case studies; in particular: a spatial data infrastructure (SDI) of a regional government concerning an endangered plant (wild grapevine) with an important potential for cultural and touristic uses in a wine-making region; an open data guide—the Digital Guide of Andalusian Cultural Heritage; a university repository connected to Europeana, which contains reports and outcomes of projects of geometric documentation of elements of heritage; a repository of an organization in charge of the protection and care of the heritage; and finally, two examples of the use of heritage building information models (HBIM) in complex monuments. After discussing the characteristics of each case, this paper concludes that, although the availability of information and tools is growing, further progress is still necessary concerning the interoperability, outreach and reuse of the different solutions. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: Public sector data analytics concerns the process of retrieving data, data analysis, publication of the results as well as re-using the data by government organizations to improve their operations and enhance public policy. This paper aims to explore the use of public sector data analytics in the Netherlands and the opportunities and challenges of this use. Design/methodology/approach: This paper finds 74 applications of public sector data analytics, identified by a Web search and consultation with policymakers. The applications are categorized by application type, organization(s) involved and application domain, and illustrative examples are used to elaborate opportunities and challenges. Findings: Public sector data analytics is most frequently used for inspection and enforcement of social services and for criminal investigation. Even though its usage is often experimental, it raises concerns for scope creep, repeated targeting of the same (group of) individuals, personal data use by third parties and the transparency of governmental processes. Research limitations/implications: Drawing on desk research, it was not always possible to identify which type of data or which technology was used in the applications that were found. Furthermore, the case studies are illustrative rather than providing an in-depth overview of opportunities and challenges of the use of data analytics in government. Originality/value: Most studies either perform a literature overview or present a single case study; this paper presents a more comprehensive overview of how a public sector uses data analytics. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Public transparency is becoming increasingly complex due to the volume of data generated by government, the plurality of uses given to public data, their dispersal over different organizations, bodies and units and the diversity of mechanisms through which they are channelled. All this requires government agencies not only to improve data management but also to adopt procedures and structures that facilitate decision-making regarding data’s use and quality. In this context, this study defines data governance as the set of principles, values and standards that guide interaction in decision-ma-king among stakeholders who create, manage and use data. This study uses the analysis of three data governance cases to identify the defining characteristics of data governance (data governance’s design, the institutional position on data governance in the organizational structure, the stakeholders involved in data governance, the interaction channels provided and the functions attributed to them). Based on these elements, three models of data governance promoted by government agencies are observed. In the light of the data governance models analysed, the final reflection identifies how data governance can contribute to improve public transparency. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

	abstract = {Introduction Increasingly, the label “data trust” is being applied to repeatable mechanisms or approaches to sharing data in a timely, fair, safe, and equitable way. However, there is an absence of practical guidance regarding how to establish and operate a data trust. Aim and approach In December 2019, the Canadian Institute for Health Information and the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence convened a working meeting of 19 people representing 15 Canadian organizations/initiatives involved in data sharing, most of which focus on public sector health data. The objective was to identify essential requirements for the establishment and operation of data trusts in the Canadian context. Preliminary requirements were discussed during the meeting and then refined as authors contributed to this manuscript. Results Twelve minimum specification requirements (“min specs”) for data trusts were identified. The foundational min spec is that data trusts must meet all legal requirements, including legal authority to collect, hold or share data. In addition, there was agreement that data trusts must have (i) an accountable governing body to ensure that the data trust achieves its stated purpose and is transparent, (ii) comprehensive data management including clear processes and qualified individuals responsible for the collection, storage, access, disclosure and use of data, (iii) training and accountability requirements for all data users and (iv) ongoing public and stakeholder engagement. Conclusions Practical guidance for the establishment and operation of data trusts was articulated in the form of 12 min specs requirements. The 12 min specs are a starting point. Future work to refine and strengthen them with members of the public, companies, and additional research data stakeholders from within and outside of Canada, is recommended.

Therefore, it is important to study management of this system and basic mechanisms used by the party and state institutions. The article is based on the analysis of open data sources, including official documents on the development of the higher education (laws, national programs, projects and plans), and the results of the Russian and Chinese scientific research. The authors consider state and party institutions as a unified system of the education system management: central and local party institutions, party organizations of the central and local government and primary organizations of the party (CPC), central and local executive authorities of the state. Party institutions of the higher education management include executive bodies of the CPC and the local provincial party committees, party organizations of the central and local governments (Ministry of Education and other State Council’s structures, local people’s governments) and primary party committees of universities. State administrative bodies in the higher education include central (State Council of the PRC including Ministry of Education and other institutions) and local administrative bodies (local people’s governments, including education committees of provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities under the central government). The main mechanism that determines activities of the party bodies and the state university management system consists of special projects and plans. The authors present five main plans for the development of the higher education system in China and identify their features and goals. © T.L. Guruleva, Wang Bing, 2020.},

	abstract = {This work reflects, based on the dialogue between Law and Software Engineering, about the current paradigm of public transparency, so that electronic portals start to produce communication between citizens and governments, and, therefore, make it materially possible the exercise of social control. Thus, the problem faced here will seek to respond in a propositional way in which way and through which mechanisms the dialogue between the duties of public transparency and software engineering can contribute to the production of communication between the Public Administration and its citizens to make the exercise of social control through transparency portals. The hypothesis is that from the dialogue between law and software engineering, using programming languages, business intelligence techniques, big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence applied to transparency portals and data in format open access made available by the Public Administration, as determined by the Access to Information Law, communication between citizens and government can be made possible through the access made possible by the advent of the internet and the development of various instruments, such as the compilation and production of automated reports, tables, references and immediate access to documents and data of a public nature. The dialectic method was used in this research. Through the use of data provided by the Open Data project (https://dadosabertos.poa.br/), from the capital Porto Alegre / RS, for the present work, data extraction related to bids and administrative contracts (Licitacon) made by the mentioned public entity and made available in commaseparatedvalues - csv format. It was possible to verify 21.946 records of bids carried out and produce some graphs that facilitate the understanding of the data. In addition to open data, it is necessary to structure and expand the Brazilian public administration itself through software engineering, based on what is currently called digital government. © 2021 Authors.

Since GovTech and Civic Tech share the goal of giving citizens better and safer lives through their engagement with government and technology, the development of online public services is characterized by the use of collaborative production methods involving various stakeholders and players. Open data, collaboration, and systematic teamwork are key to understanding this production of heterarchical structures. This study reviews previous cases of collaboration between GovTech and Civic Tech, identifies the dominant mechanisms of the smart society, and summarizes existing pedagogical and industrial theoretical systems, mindsets, and skillsets with the aim of developing content for a university course. Double loop learning, design thinking, the Agile methodology, and the lean principle are identified as theoretical systems. Our findings are arranged so that they can be applied in the content of a university-level educational technology course, which we designed to develop students’ transformative competencies to enable them to become active citizens. In addition, we compared the processes involved in observed theoretical systems and conventional pedagogical theories to clarify the differences in their mechanisms. We conclude with a discussion of the need to recognize frameworks of different paradigms to prepare students for transformative social activities. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

Faced with a situation of this magnitude, governments have introduced transparency measures into their daily routines to provide citizens with up-to-date, quality information on the pandemic. This has also affected journalistic practices, as the volume of information dedicated to the coronavirus has been increasing in the media. Data journalism is presented as one of the most recurrent formulas of digital media, with the development of maps and graphs using official data. Methodology. This research aims to find out, on the one hand, the degree of information transparency of Ibero-American governments on the disease, as well as the development of open journalism, data journalism and other practices by the media to report on the coronavirus. To this end, an evaluation has been made of the COVID-19 information portals in 12 Ibero-American countries and of the two most relevant digital media in each country. Conclusions. Despite the enormous effort made by the institutions to inform the public about the health emergency, the transparency portals present various deficiencies. The media, on the other hand, have mainly developed data journalism, but they have not promoted media transparency or citizen participation in the elaboration of contents. © 2020, University of La Laguna.

In this paper, we propose a new alliancebased framework of development scenarios for the Chinese MaaS system. At the same time, by distinguishing the experience and lessons between the UbiGo project in Sweden and Whim project in Finland, we summarize that the key to the success of prior pilot projects is the cooperation of industry alliance, government policy support, and data sharing mechanism. Moreover, this paper also proposes some MaaS solutions for the obstacles of alliance-based cooperation, data resource sharing, business model selection, operation conditions, development path, policy support and other aspects in China. © 2021 by the authors.

The data were gathered by means of a survey which obtained 135 responses from researchers based in five research universities in Malaysia. The main conclusions are: (a) the researchers are aware of open data, yet, they are not practising it as shown in the mean scores, as well as in their responses towards the statements asked; (b) unclear information on data privacy policy, misuse of data, and the fear of losing publication opportunity are part of disincentives for data sharing. The requisite for open data understanding, practices and attitudinal change is needed for these may impact research practices, government policies and scientific knowledge, leading to research transparency and accountability, social benefit and economic growth. This paper concludes with a discussion that policies incentivizing the sharing and reuse of open data, as well as tools and guidance to support data sharing, and a strong incentives and rewards to implement open data among researchers, should be encouraged. Future studies should look into the importance of rewards for data sharing among researchers' institutions. Studies bridging the gap between policy and practices of open data should be examined, if true openness in research is to be established in Malaysia. © Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology.},

The aims of this study are twofold: 1) to systematically review the literature on individual citizens’ drivers and inhibitors for engaging with OGD and 2) to develop a conceptual model of citizen engagement with OGD based on the findings of the literature review. To attain this objective, the authors systematically analyzed 52 papers published in the period 2009-2019. Seven categories of drivers of citizen engagement are identified: citizen’s profile, personal, performance-related, economic, social, technical, and political. Three groups of inhibitors are also identified: citizen’s profile, technical, and political. This study helps in understanding how the engagement of citizens can be enhanced.

	abstract = {Purpose: Citizen engagement is key to the success of many Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives. However, not much is known regarding how this type of engagement emerges. This study aims to investigate the necessary conditions for the emergence of citizen-led engagement with OGD and to identify which factors stimulate this type of engagement. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors created a systematic overview of the literature to develop a conceptual model of conditions and factors of OGD citizen engagement at the societal, organizational and individual level. Second, the authors used the conceptual model to systematically study citizens’ engagement in the case of a particular OGD initiative, namely, the digitization of presidential election results data in Indonesia in 2014. The authors used multiple information sources, including interviews and documents, to explore the conditions and factors of OGD citizen-led engagement in this case. Findings: From the literature the authors identified five conditions for the emergence of OGD citizen-led engagement as follows: the availability of a legal and political framework that grants a mandate to open up government data, sufficient budgetary resources allocated for OGD provision, the availability of OGD feedback mechanisms, citizens’ perceived ease of engagement and motivated citizens. In the literature, the authors found six factors contributing to OGD engagement as follows: democratic culture, the availability of supporting institutional arrangements, the technical factors of OGD provision, the availability of citizens’ resources, the influence of social relationships and citizens’ perceived data quality. Some of these conditions and factors were found to be less important in the studied case, namely, citizens’ perceived ease of engagement and citizens’ perceived data quality. Moreover, the authors found several new conditions that were not mentioned in the studied literature, namely, citizens’ sense of urgency, competition among citizen-led OGD engagement initiatives, the diversity of citizens’ skills and capabilities and the intensive use of social media. The difference between the conditions and factors that played an important role in the case and those derived from the literature review might be because of the type of OGD engagement that the authors studied, namely, citizen-led engagement, without any government involvement. Research limitations/implications: The findings are derived using a single case study approach. Future research can investigate multiple cases and compare the conditions and factors for citizen-led engagement with OGD in different contexts. Practical implications: The conditions and factors for citizen-led engagement with OGD have been evaluated in practice and discussed with public managers and practitioners through interviews. Governmental organizations should prioritize and stimulate those conditions and factors that enhance OGD citizen engagement to create more value with OGD. Originality/value: While some research on government-led engagement with OGD exists, there is hardly any research on citizen-led engagement with OGD. This study is the first to develop a conceptual model of necessary conditions and factors for citizen engagement with OGD. Furthermore, the authors applied the developed multilevel conceptual model to a case study and gathered empirical evidence of OGD engagement and its contributions to solving societal problems, rather than staying at the conceptual level. This research can be used to investigate citizen engagement with OGD in other cases and offers possibilities for systematic cross-case lesson-drawing. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The Open Government Data portals (OGD), thanks to the presence of thousands of georeferenced datasets, containing spatial information are of extreme interest for any analysis or process relating to the territory. For this to happen, users must be enabled to access these datasets and reuse them. An element often considered as hindering the full dissemination of OGD data is the quality of their metadata. Starting from an experimental investigation conducted on over 160,000 geospatial datasets belonging to six national and international OGD portals, this work has as its first objective to provide an overview of the usage of these portals measured in terms of datasets views and downloads. Furthermore, to assess the possible influence of the quality of the metadata on the use of geospatial datasets, an assessment of the metadata for each dataset was carried out, and the correlation between these two variables was measured. The results obtained showed a significant underutilization of geospatial datasets and a generally poor quality of their metadata. In addition, a weak correlation was found between the use and quality of the metadata, not such as to assert with certainty that the latter is a determining factor of the former. © 2021 by the authors.

Discussion starts with a brief reference to the growth machine thesis and its emphasis on the interests of local land and real estate owners. This theory serves as a contrasting point for the second element of our framework, the platform economy, which brings digital platforms and the transnational capitalist class into the picture. The transition from the urban growth machines of the industrial age to the digital growth platforms of the information age imply a radical change in the context of urban economic development. On this basis, we discuss cities’ need to adjust their growth strategies to the conditions of the emerging platform economy. Our illustrative case is the capital region of Finland. We interviewed officials and experts who hold key positions in the design of economic development policy in the three largest cities of this area. The empirical results show that the platform economy is rather vaguely conceptualized, and its challenges are ambiguously addressed. Cities have, however, started to adopt platform and ecosystem thinking in their strategies and established urban innovation platforms, talent and start-up attraction programs, and open data initiatives that reflect the gradual adoption of platform logic in urban economic development. © 2020 by the authors.},

Data from the IFEZ were collected between January 2017 and December 2018 across the smart system's four functional areas (intelligent video surveillance, suspicious vehicle surveillance, emergency alerts, and abnormal sound sources) and 10 types of situations (emergency, violence, civil complaints, intrusion, kidnapping, loitering, throwing, suspicious vehicle, collision explosion, and sudden event). Descriptive statistics were analyzed to show the limitation of the smart crime prevention service. The results revealed three significant insights into the best practices for smart crime prevention services in smart cities: first, smart crime prevention services are required to verify the accuracy and consistency of collected data; second, the government must establish a consistent process to link all crime prevention services and to secure data linkages; and third, the government must urgently foster and secure experts in specialized institutions to carry out these advised functions. Ultimately, these findings suggest that in-depth discussions of data collection and sharing are required to ensure the optimal development of smart city security services. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Although many countries have been implementing integrated care, the scale-up remains difficult. Macro-level system barriers play an important role. By selecting three key policies, which have implemented integrated care in Belgium over the last 10 years, we aim to go beyond the identification of their specific barriers and facilitators to obtain an overarching generic view. Methods: 27 participants were purposefully selected, to include all important stakeholders involved on the macro-level in chronic care in Belgium. Semi-structured interviews were guided by a timeline of policies and an inductive thematic analysis was performed. Results: Barriers and facilitators were identified on both health care and policy level. The major factors restraining the scale-up of integrated care are the fee-for-service reimbursement system, limited data sharing and the fragmentation of responsibilities between different levels of government. Remarkably, these factors strongly interact. Discussion: This paper highlights the importance of homogenization of responsibilities of governments regarding integrated care and the interdependency of policy and health care system factors. A whole system change is needed instead of the current Belgian model of prolonged search for common ground between conflicting opinions. Political commitment and citizen participation will be crucial. © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background Use of routinely collected patient data for research and service planning is an explicit policy of the UK National Health Service and UK government. Much clinical information is recorded in free-text letters, reports and notes. These text data are generally lost to research, due to the increased privacy risk compared with structured data. We conducted a citizens' jury which asked members of the public whether their medical free-text data should be shared for research for public benefit, to inform an ethical policy. Methods Eighteen citizens took part over 3 days. Jurors heard a range of expert presentations as well as arguments for and against sharing free text, and then questioned presenters and deliberated together. They answered a questionnaire on whether and how free text should be shared for research, gave reasons for and against sharing and suggestions for alleviating their concerns. Results Jurors were in favour of sharing medical data and agreed this would benefit health research, but were more cautious about sharing free-text than structured data. They preferred processing of free text where a computer extracted information at scale. Their concerns were lack of transparency in uses of data, and privacy risks. They suggested keeping patients informed about uses of their data, and giving clear pathways to opt out of data sharing. Conclusions Informed citizens suggested a transparent culture of research for the public benefit, and continuous improvement of technology to protect patient privacy, to mitigate their concerns regarding privacy risks of using patient text data. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

	abstract = {By considering public safety as a relevant component of a smart city framework, the development and use of city dashboards that explore the spatio-temporal monitoring of crime incidence to help local governments base their decision-making process on evidence is becoming more relevant. This research deals with the case study of the state of Aguascalientes, Mexico, whose capital hosts the annual San Marcos Fair, considered the most important fair in the country. By developing an online dynamic platform consisting of several different modules that rely on the use of geovisual analytics for dynamic and interactive data display and exploration, authorities can gain insights about the times and locations of the impact of criminal incidence, detect patterns over space and time, and look into what actions could be put in place. This becomes useful in advancing a circular model of the smart city in which urban processes are observed, data is collected and analyzed, management and decision actions occur, and more data is collected to measure their effectiveness. By comparing statistics for the three year period of 2016-2018, it is found that the second year of the study had a significant decrease in pedestrian crime incidence during the Fair, supporting the use of city dashboards with geovisual analytics to help monitor urban processes and aid authorities in making decisions. Further research is needed to uncover more efficient practices to achieve inter-institutional collaboration and data sharing schemes that adhere to and boost the principles of the smart city. © 2020 by the author.},

From an innovation perspective, we explore the current gap between the promise and practice of open government data. Based on Strategic Niche Management (SNM), we identify different phases in the open data innovation process. This study uses a living lab in a province in the Netherlands to stimulate the provision and use of open data for collaborative processes and analyses the mechanisms that condition the success of this innovation process. The results based on six interventions over a period of two years show that our interventions stimulated the use of open data and raised awareness within government, but that various mechanisms inhibited the realization of the ambitions of open government data. We conclude that the challenge of open government data as an innovation lies in finding a way to scale up the provision of open data: innovation niches are established but “regime changes” do not take place. Scaling up open government data use requires strong managerial commitment and changes in the wider organizational landscape such as constructing formal and informal rules and technological developments that stimulate debate about open data practices. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

In this context, a collaboration was undertaken between multiple actors in the La Spezia municipality aimed at: (i) monitoring building characteristics, using specific and valuable indicators, and (ii) increasing the knowledge of geo-hydrological hazards across residents and local land planners (iii) implementing local emergency civil protection plan. An extensive mobile data collection was carried out through apps specifically developed for Android and IOS mobile devices. The digital forms were differentiated on the basis of the potential hazard: one of 46 fields and one of 125 fields designed for buildings respectively located in flood prone areas and in medium to very high landslide susceptibility areas. The digital version of the forms was designed using the Open Data Kit (ODK) and GISCloud client-server approach. All the collected data, including geospatial locations and images, were automatically sent to a central server, stored and organized in a database. Geospatial data-analysis and maps resulted useful in evaluating possible impacts to exposed buildings to potential geo-hydrological processes. The proposed public participation method for data-gathering increased the knowledge across residents providing a better understanding of the urban systems, of the buildings condition and their relation respect to the geo-hydrological risk. The method can be considered as part of the decision support systems for civil protection purposes to better planning geo-hydrological mitigation measures. The application of mobile technology for data collection can be effectively used when local government resources are limited. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been associated with negative mental and physical health consequences. Neighbourhood police officers (NPOs) are thought to be well placed to identify and support children experiencing ACEs. Within this paper, we describe a qualitative exploration of an initiative deployed by a large UK police force which aimed to aid early identification of young people with ACEs using police data and provide subsequent support given by NPOs. A thematic analysis was conducted using transcripts from three focus groups of NPOs, supplemented by questionnaires. Key themes identified in both sets of data offer reflections for policing and other public service provision seeking to target on the basis of ACEs, including: limitations in the usefulness of police data to identify childhood adversity; challenges using the ACEs framework as a means to target such ‘early intervention’; and debates regarding the appropriate role of the police in supporting young people in adversity. Prior to replication of this intervention elsewhere, there are several points to consider: whether police data alone are sufficient in identifying ACEs; ensuring clarity regarding the role of the public sector agencies in such intervention; and determining an apt measure of success for the scheme. Key practitioner messages: Modelling using only police data can provide insight into the population of children who may have suffered from ACEs but may not provide significant opportunities for early intervention There is a clear need for defining the role of UK police forces in the delivery of early intervention It is evident that multi-agency working/data sharing is crucial to preventing the duplication of referrals and interventions conducted with young people who have experienced ACEs. ‘There is a clear need for defining the role of UK police forces in the delivery of early intervention’. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Open government has come to be closely associated with innovation for inclusive development (IID). These two areas of practice and research have converged around similar mechanisms aimed at achieving inclusive development outcomes including: open interaction between government, technologists and end-users in the design of policies and services; open, market-oriented approaches to delivering public services and meeting the needs of citizens; and a central role for information and communication technologies (ICTs) in policy development and innovation activities. We argue, however, that an uncritical adoption of open, ICT-oriented practices risks shifting responsibility and trust for governance and development outcomes to largely unaccountable global and national network enterprises. Taking South Africa as our primary focus, including its new White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI), we note a renewed interest in adopting open government practices in relation to IID. More significant, we suggest, is the emergence of ‘grassroots’, hybrid civic-technology innovation networks at the fringes of formal open government initiatives. This article considers new questions that arise around how these grassroots movements sustain meaningful interaction with mainstream STI processes, how public officials may engage with such movements in order to meet national development outcomes, and the role of ICT in these spaces. © 2020 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.},

	abstract = {Governments are investing in precision medicine (PM) with the aim of improving healthcare through the use of genomic analyses and data analytics to develop tailored treatment approaches for individual patients. The success of PM is contingent upon clear public communications that engender trust and secure the social licence to collect and share large population-wide data sets because specific consent for each data re-use is impractical. Variation in the terminology used by different programmes used to describe PM may hinder clear communication and threaten trust. Language is used to create common understanding and expectations regarding precision medicine between researchers, clinicians and the volunteers. There is a need to better understand public interpretations of PM-related terminology. This paper reports on a qualitative study involving 24 focus group participants in the multi-lingual context of Singapore. The study explored how Singaporeans interpret and understand the terms ‘precision medicine’ and ‘personalised medicine’, and which term they felt more aptly communicates the concept and goals of PM. Results suggest that participants were unable to readily link the terms with this area of medicine and initially displayed preferences for the more familiar term of ‘personalised’. The use of visual aids to convey key concepts resonated with participants, some of whom then indicated preferences for the term ‘precision’ as being a more accurate description of PM research. These aids helped to facilitate dialogue around the ethical and social value, as well as the risks, of PM. Implications for programme developers and policy makers are discussed. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Municipal open data projects are motivated by a desire to democratize data access and knowledge production, strengthen transparency, and advance cities socially and economically. However, their effects and implications are insufficiently analyzed. This paper examines civic engagement in open data in Cape Town, South Africa, the continent's first municipal-level open data initiative. Findings reveal how local civil society organizations have been driving engagement with municipal open data as part of their recent turn towards technology and data-driven forms of public engagement and activism. This analysis highlights the important role of the “smart civil society organization”—occupying a position between the smart city and smart citizen—that is developing significant capacity to produce and share data about the city's informal settlements with stakeholders in government, the private sector, and wider society. Minimal engagement with or recognition of civil society efforts illustrates the limits to the city's philosophy of data openness, which is largely restricted to releasing selected government datasets to the public. The notion of “bi-directional open data” is developed here to characterize emerging possibilities for data openness between governments and the public. This may be particularly relevant for cities like Cape Town with a highly active, capable, and data-literate civil society. © 2020 The Authors.

Policy and service innovation labs constitute one part of a broader “open innovation” movement which also includes open data, behavioral insights, digital services, data science units, visualization capabilities, and agile and lean methods. This article argues that we need to step back and better understand these “ecologies” of innovation capabilities that have emerged across public service institutions, and to recognize that as fellow “innovation” traveling companions they collectively seek to transform the culture of government and public service institutions, producing more effective, efficient and tailored policies and services. This article introduces analytic frameworks that should help locate policy and innovation labs amidst these other innovating entities. First, it delineates the various units and initiatives which can be seen as committed to new ways of working and innovating in public service institutions, often relying on “open innovation” rhetoric and approaches. Second, it shows how–despite the diversity among these entities–they nevertheless share similar attributes as “adhocracies” and are located as part of a broader movement and class of organizations. Third, we locate these diverse OI entities amidst broader public service systems using the Competing Values Framework. Fourth, this article situates the challenges confronting OI units developing and sustaining or broadening niches in public service systems. Finally, it identifies future research questions to take up. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

The World Bank acknowledges the importance of land management practices and promotes it as the Ease Of Doing Business (EODB) indicators for a supportive environment for economic activities. In improving a city's competitiveness, local governments need to establish a reliable Land Administration System to organize unrenewable urban land and spaces and simultaneously reduce information asymmetry between actors. A modernized LAS is needed to accommodate the four functions of land management: land tenure, land value, land-use planning, and land development. The ISO 19152:2012 on Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) standard offers a foundation to establish information interoperability in land management that is crucial in modeling the relationship between people and land (and space), the geometrical components, as well as documented Rights, Responsibilities, and Restrictions (RRRs) in land. To promote the exchange of information between the domains of land administration domain and spatial planning, an extension of LADM, the Spatial Plan Information Package (SP Package), was proposed to support cities organizing information in land management. This article presents the proposed spatial plan information extension to the LADM country profile for Indonesia. This work also develops a proof-of-concept of the package in the two biggest Indonesian cities (Jakarta and Bandung) with adaptation to the current national data management policies. Our research shows positive results on making the LADM country profile reflect on the real condition and improving LAS's adaptability to be integrated with the Spatial Information Infrastructure. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to assess if the extent of openness and the coverage of data sets released by European governments have a significant impact on citizen trust in public institutions. Design/methodology/approach: Data for openness and coverage have been collected from the Open Data Inventory 2018 (ODIN), by Open Data Watch; institutional trust is built up as a formative construct based on the European Social Survey (ESS), Round 9. The relations between the open government data features and trust have been tested on the basis of structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings: The paper reveals that as European governments improve data openness, disaggregation, and time coverage, people tend to trust them more. However, the size of the effect is still small and, comparatively, data coverage effect on citizens’ confidence is more than twice than the impact of openness. Research limitations: This paper analyzes the causal effect of Open Government Data (OGD) features captured in a certain moment of time. In upcoming years, as OGD is implemented and a more consistent effect on people is expected, time series analysis will provide with a deeper insight. Practical implications: Public officers should continue working in the development of a technological framework that contributes to make OGD truly open. They should improve the added value of the increasing amount of open data currently available in order to boost internal and external innovations valuable both for public agencies and citizens. Originality/value: In a field of knowledge with little quantitative empirical evidence, this paper provides updated support for the positive effect of OGD strategies and it also points out areas of improvement in terms of the value that citizens can get from OGD coverage and openness. © 2021 Sciendo.

This article analyses those developments, focusing on the 2018 German Federal Supreme Court decision Museumsfotos, Art. 14 of the 2019 Copyright and Related Rights in the Digital Single Market Directive, and relevant provisions of the 2019 Open Data and the Re-use of Public Sector Information Directive. It reveals that despite the growing consensus for protecting the public domain, there is a lack of practical guidance throughout the EU in legislation, jurisprudence, and literature on what reproduction media might attract new intellectual property rights, from scans to photography to 3D data. This leaves ample room for copyright to be claimed in reproduction materials produced by new technologies. Moreover, owners remain able to impose other restrictive measures around public domain works and data, like onsite photography bans, website terms and conditions, and exclusive arrangements with third parties. This article maps out these various legal gaps. It argues the pro-open culture spirit of the EU Directives should be embraced and provides guidance for Member States and heritage institutions around national implementation. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background In the case of immigrant health and wellness, data are the key limiting factor, where comprehensive national knowledge on immigrant health and health service utilisation is limited. New data and data silos are an inherent response to the increase in technology in the collection and storage of data. The Health Data Cooperative (HDC) model allows members to contribute, store, and manage their health-related information, and members are the rightful data owners and decision-makers to data sharing (e g. research communities, commercial entities, government bodies). Objective This review attempts to scope the literature on HDC and fulfill the following objectives: 1) identify and describe the type of literature that is available on the HDC model; 2) describe the key themes related to HDCs; and 3) describe the benefits and challenges related to the HDC model. Methods We conducted a scoping review using the five-stage framework outlined by Arskey and O'Malley to systematically map literature on HDCs using two search streams: 1) a database and grey literature search; and 2) an internet search. We included all English records that discussed health data cooperative and related key terms. We used a thematic analysis to collate information into comprehensive themes. Results Through a comprehensive screening process, we found 22 database and grey literature records, and 13 Internet search records. Three major themes that are important to stakeholders include data ownership, data security, and data flow and infrastructure. Conclusions The results of this study are an informative first step to the study of the HDC model, or an establishment of a HDC in immigrant communities. June 2020 © The Authors.},

Challenges include insufficient data quality, lack of understanding of data, poor analysis, wrong interpretation, confusion about the outcomes, and imposing a pre-defined view. These challenges can easily result in misconceptions, wrong decision-making, creating a blurred picture resulting in less transparency and accountability, and ultimately in even less trust in the government. Principles guiding the design of dashboards are presented. Dashboards need to be complemented by mechanisms supporting citizens' engagement, data interpretation, governance and institutional arrangements. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {It is widely argued that blockchain technology (BCT) is one of the most promising trends nowadays. The most prominent characteristic of this technology is the improved sense of trust to the shared information provided by BCT applications as well as the ubiquitous access to the data ledger. At the same time, governments pursue amplified trust from their citizens, increasing transparency through shared information and open data. Since BCT supports this strategic goal of governments worldwide, numerous governments try to capitalize on the advances of this technology through testing the results of pilot applications in different vertical governmental sectors. Even though there are several implementations in the government sector, there is no comprehensive study towards the analysis of the major characteristics of these developments. This paper moves towards the fulfillment of this gap by conducting a thorough analysis of e-government pilot applications of BCT at a European level providing information to policymakers and practitioners about the grey areas of this technology. © 2021 IGI Global.

	abstract = {We present the design and development of an open-source web application called Water Data Explorer (WDE), designed to retrieve water resources observation and model data from data catalogs that follow the WaterOneFlow and WaterML Service-Oriented Architecture standards. WDE is a fully customizable web application built using the Tethys Platform development environment. As it is open source, it can be deployed on the web servers of international government agencies, non-governmental organizations, research teams, and others. Water Data Explorer provides uniform access to international data catalogs, such as the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science (CUAHSI) Hydrologic Information System (HIS) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Hydrological Observing System (WHOS), as well as to local data catalogs that support the WaterOneFlow and WaterML standards. WDE supports data discovery, visualization, downloading, and basic data interpolation. It can be customized for different regions by modifying the user interface (i.e., localization), as well as by including pre-defined data catalogs and data sources. Access to WDE functionality is provided by a new open-source Python package called “Pywaterml” which provides programmable access to WDE methods to discover, visualize, download, and interpolate data. We present two case studies that access the CUAHSI HIS and WHOS catalogs and demonstrate regional customization, data discovery from WaterOneFlow web services, data visualization of time series observations, and data downloading. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {In this paper we focus on the emerging phenomenon of Open Government Data Platforms (OGDPs), in particular those that provide open performance data to general public. Governments world-wide continue to implement these platforms, aiming to increase transparency and accountability. However, in spite of their positive intentions, ODGPs that provide performance data (e.g. about schools or hospitals) are reported to create serious harmful social effects. While the related literature has reported numerous cases of these unintended effects, the questions regarding why and how they emerge remain open. This is not surprising, given the complexity and dynamics of processes instigated through the use of ODGPs by a very large number of known and unknowable actors. Through a diffractive reading of complexity theories, in particular Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) and sociomateriality, in this paper we propose a Complex Adaptive Sociomaterial Systems (CASS) theorization of OGDPs. Drawing from a case of OGDP in Australia called My School, which provides open performance data for more than 10.000 schools, we demonstrate how the proposed theoretical lens of CASS enables us to reveal and explain why and how these platforms perform unintended, yet serious social harm. Given that OGDPs are rapidly emerging around the world, our research opens a pathway for a research-informed public discourse about their harmful effects and responsibilities of different stakeholders. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Scottish Government's proposal to introduce a "Named Person"scheme was intended to improve child protection and wellbeing in Scotland, by allocating an identified Named Person to every child in Scotland. The scheme was met by considerable concern from a range of parties, and was challenged in the courts on the basis that the data sharing provisions infringed the data protection and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (echr) privacy rights of children and parents. As a result of the complexities of introducing lawful data sharing provisions, the scheme has now been scrapped, without ever being introduced. However, at no point was there any sustained analysis of the impact of Article 5 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (uncrc) on the Named Person scheme: to what extent would the Scottish Government proposals have helped parents meet their obligations under Article 5? Or would they in fact have infringed parents' and children's rights? This article provides a case study of Article 5 in practice, by setting out the background to the now-defunct Named Person scheme, before going on to analyse its interaction -and compliance -with the State Party's obligations under Article 5. © 2020 Copyright 2020 by Gillian Black.},

These restrictions classify the population into the states of a flow network where people are coming and going according to pandemic evolution. A new dynamical model based on flow networks is proposed. The model fits well with the well-known SIR family model and add a new perspective of the evolution of the infected people among the states. This perspective allows to model different scenarios and illustrates the evolution and trends of the pandemic because it is based on the open data daily provided by the governments. To measure the severity of the pandemic along the time, a danger index (DI) is proposed in addition to the well-known R0 index. This index is a function of infected cases, number of deaths and recover cases while the transmission index R0 depends only on the infected cases. These two indexes are compared in relation to data from Spain and the Netherlands and additionally, it is shown the relation of the danger index with the policy applied by the governments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Open government data platforms are aimed at enhancing transparency and participation. Even though the promises of these platforms are high, their full potential has not yet been reached. Scholars have identified technical and quality barriers of open data usage. Although useful, these issues fail to acknowledge that the meaning of open data also depends on the context and people involved. In this study we analyze open data usage from a practice lens – as a social construction that emerges over time in interaction with governments and users in a specific context – to enhance our understanding of the role of context and agency in the development of open data platforms. This study is based on innovative action-based research in which civil servants’ and citizens’ initiatives collaborate to find solutions for public problems using an open data platform. It provides an insider perspective of Open Data Work. The findings show that an absence of a shared cognitive framework for understanding open data and a lack of high-quality datasets can prevent processes of collaborative learning. Our contextual approach stresses the need for open data practices that work on the basis of rich interactions with users rather than government-centric implementations. © The Author(s) 2018.},

It is a tool for communication and dissemination of information to support decisions in risk mitigation policies, land use planning, preliminary design of infrastructures, prioritization of mitigation measures, management of civil protection emergencies, and environmental impact assessment. The challenges that have been faced during the design and development of the platform concern usability, access on multiple devices (smartphones, tablets, desktops), interoperability, transparency, reuse of information and software in the public sector, and improvement of the updating of the Italian Landslide Inventory. The methodologies and solutions adopted to address them include Progressive Web Application (PWA), Application Programming Interface (API), open standards, open libraries, and software. A landslide inventory management system has been developed via REST API for data entry and approval workflow in order to maintain the inventory in a distributed and collaborative manner. As a result, IdroGEO provides a public service for citizens, public administration, and professionals, using the “mobile first” approach and with scalable and reliable architecture.

The current directions of changes fit into building administration that is based on open public data, which will not only ensure wide access to public information but will also create and gather data in a way that will allow for the further economic use of those data by the private sector. Resolving the existing problems in exercising information rights and implementing the projected changes will both pose a considerable challenge to the public administration.

The question is whether the responsible actors and if the universities are ready to implement the change. The significance of open access has amplified in Sweden. Earlier research has brought to light that the collection and preservation of research data are often surrounded by ambiguous rules and lack a comprehensive structure. For example, archiving is not given enough consideration in connection to research projects and researchers often tend to save their material on platforms that are not persistent over time. This article is based upon a qualitative research approach where 15 semi-structured interviews have been used as primarily data sources to investigate the implementation of open access of research data and scientific publications. The article investigated how Swedish universities and public authorities were working with archiving and implementation of open research data and their opinions on open access. The results displayed a lack of coordination, resources and infrastructure but also that common agreed nomenclature were missing. The management of research data was not part of an overall recordkeeping strategy. One explanation could be differences in the information culture among researchers and archivists. Social sciences theory has been combined with archival theory in order to explain the reasons to this. These have been put in relation to the principles of the open data directive. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The values of open data in terms of accessibility, research scrutiny, and data transparency are important ethical values that all scientists should aspire to achieve. As part of the drive for open science in general, the development of open data and, associated with it, open access, are key characteristics. Although these may be the key drivers for open data in science, the potential to inform policies and to support non-academic sectors are also high on the political agenda for geographical science, placing the issue of “open data” firmly within the context of the neoliberalisation of universities and academics. Open data becomes a common resource from which other researchers, business, and government can extract value. This paper addresses the contexts in which open data is being encouraged and identifies concerns that these policies may need to be sensitive to, such as existing and emerging power relations within which data is produced and consumed. Viewing open data in this context illuminates some potential ethical issues that the benign ideal of open data could produce. We explore the importance of viewing research and research outputs within the dimensions of a dynamic set of power relationships, which often go unnoticed by practitioners. This suggests the debate over open data needs to be sensitive to the contexts within which researchers work and implicitly emphasise the key role that data, and its production and sharing, play in these relationships. By thinking about the different values of “data” defined by these relations, it is possible to untangle how the seemingly unquestionable drive to open data may pose problems for some researchers. It is suggested, however, that some of these potential issues could be creatively used to address issues of unequal power relations and so enable a greater and mutually rewarding flow of open data between researchers.

Differently to previous work, the approach exploits external knowledge extracted from Open Government Data for processing the citizens’ proposals and debates of the platform, enabling to characterize targeted issues and problems, and analyze the levels of discussion, support and controversy raised by the proposals. As a result of our analysis, we derive a number of insights and conclusions of interest and value for both citizens and government stakeholders in decision and policy making tasks. Among others, we show that proposals targeting issues that affect large majorities tend to be supported by citizens and ultimately implemented by the city council, but leave aside other very important issues affecting minority groups. Our study reveals that most controversial, likely relevant, problems do not always receive sufficient attention in e-participation. Moreover, it identifies several types of controversy, related to ideological and socioeconomic factors and political attitudes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

A vibrant agenda on open government has flourished since, with critical advances on the conceptual front, but much less empirical testing of its propositions. This article makes use of a recognized typology of co-production initiatives in order to implement a Cox hazards survival analysis of 465 open government platforms from a global sample in 87 countries. Its main findings suggest that government-initiated collaborations have the lowest risk of termination and that citizen-to-government initiatives the highest. They also show that while internationally-exerted pressure for openness favors the genesis of open government platforms, it does not affect their survival chances. © 2020 The Author},

	abstract = {Besides OpenStreetMap (OSM), there are other local sources, such as open government data (OGD), that have the potential to enrich the modeling process with decision criteria that uniquely reflect some local patterns. However, both data are affected by uncertainty issues, which limits their usability. This work addresses the imprecisions on suitability layers generated from such data. The proposed method is founded on fuzzy logic theories. The model integrates OGD, OSM data and remote sensing products and generate reliable landfill suitability results. A comparison analysis demonstrates that the proposed method generates more accurate, representative and reliable suitability results than traditional methods. Furthermore, the method has facilitated the introduction of open government data for suitability studies, whose fusion improved estimations of population distribution and land-use mapping than solely relying on free remotely sensed images. The proposed method is applicable for preparing decision maps from open datasets that have undergone similar generalization procedures as the source of their uncertainty. The study provides evidence for the applicability of OGD and other related open data initiatives (ODIs) for land-use suitability studies, especially in developing countries. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {With climate change driving an increasingly stronger influence over governments and municipalities, sustainable development, and renewable energy are gaining traction across the globe. This is reflected within the EU 2030 agenda, that envisions a future where there is universal access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy. One of the challenges to achieve this vision lies on the low reliability of certain renewable sources. While both particulars and public entities try to reach self-sufficiency through sustainable energy generation, it is unclear how much investment is needed to mitigate the unreliability introduced by natural factors such as varying wind speed and daylight across the year. In this sense, a tool that aids predicting the energy output of sustainable sources across the year for a particular location can aid greatly in making sustainable energy investments more efficient. In this paper, we make use of Open Data sources, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and installations distributed across Europe to create such tool through the application of Artificial Neural Networks. We analyze how the different factors affect the prediction of energy production and how Open Data can be used to predict the expected output of sustainable sources. As a result, we facilitate users the necessary information to decide how much they wish to invest according to the desired energy output for their particular location. Compared to state-of-the-art proposals, our solution provides an abstraction layer focused on energy production, rather that radiation data, and can be trained and tailored for different locations using Open Data. Finally, our tests show that our proposal improves the accuracy of the forecasting, obtaining a lower mean squared error (MSE) of 0.040 compared to an MSE 0.055 from other proposals in the literature. © 2020 by the authors.},

Objective: This study aims to analyze initiatives Transparência Covid-19 and Open Covid Pledge, bringing to light the discussion of open data and intellectual property in the advancement of science, scientific collaboration, and the socialization of knowledge. Method: Methodologically, this is a descriptive research with a qualitative approach, carried out through a bibliographic review (from 2010 to 2021) and documentary research, in order to provide a critical analysis of open data and intellectual property. Results: The fight against the pandemic highlights the importance of initiatives, which seek to assess the quality of transparency of open data made available by public agencies, as well as to promote social participation, monitoring and encouraging government actions contributing to the development and conduct of public policies. The sharing of PI has a fundamental role when it is placed as an incentive instrument and not as a barrier to access to information and data for technological innovation and scientific advancement. Conclusion: We conclude, that the discussion about open data and PI, through a look by Open Science, shows us the importance of these in confronting the pandemic about its barriers and uses for the Health area and for society in the sense of socialization and sharing of knowledge. © 2021 Universidade Estadual de Campinas.

However, researchers have drawn attention to the ineffectiveness of such initiatives unless they are designed taking into account the local context and ecosystem of actors. Yet, literature review demonstrates a gap in addressing individual motivations of actors, particularly discrete civil society actors, to use open data. Building upon studies of individual motivations in open government, we propose a heuristic model of interconnection between societal outcomes of open data and actors' individual motivations. Analysis of the open data initiative and its ecosystem in Lyon is based on interviews and platform analysis. Our findings show that civil society actors in Lyon have the expertise to create knowledge and services from open data, but fail to appropriate it for lack of communication channels with platform managers. Consequently, this paper discusses possible modalities of interaction and proposes a further research agenda to better understand the connection between individual motivations, open data platform design and broader societal outcomes. © 2020 Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

The present study aims to identify the Brazilian Federal Universities that have already implemented the Brazilian Open Data Policy from Decree n. 8.777 / 2016, how many are already with data open in the national portal, and, what criteria are being followed to build their Open Data Plans (PDA), if there is an indication of evolution for Open Science, public transparency strand that is committed to dissemination of research data developed in academic institutions in Brazil. Method. The research was based on the bibliographic research of reference scientific articles on the subject and techniques of documentary analysis to study the open data plans available in the data portal (data.gov.br) to identify what kind of information the universities are making available. Results. According to the results, it was possible to verify that there are difficulties on the part of the institutions to comply with the national policy since only 42\% of the Brazilian public universities are already with data in the portal. In some of them, it is identified that the schedule for opening the data was not put into practice in its entirety, most 58\% still do not comply with what the policy advocates. Conclusions. The indicator of more than half of the universities outside the national data portal points out that the policy objective compromises the public transparency of these organizations. In the perspective of finding in the PDAs information that indicate the evolution of the Open Data for Open Science, it was not possible to identify any information for this evolution in the transparency of the institutions, it is suggested an in-depth study on this subject in all Brazilian federal universities. © 2020 University of Pittsburgh.

	abstract = {Most urban growth is taking place in the developing countries of the Global South through informal settlements. This form of development is usually strongly opposed by governments and local administrations. However, several works compared them to vernacular urban centres, such as medieval towns, and praised their human-scale qualities. If this similarity were to be systemically assessed on a larger scale, informal settlements would gain more recognition and legitimation. This, in turn, can potentially impact policy making. In this paper, we propose a replicable methodology based on the use of open data to investigate similarities between informal and medieval settlements, through statistical comparison of metrics of urban form and correlation analysis between densities of amenities and street centrality (a fundamental relationship at the basis of city functioning). This methodology is tested on three informal settlements in Sub-Saharan Africa and three Italian medieval towns. Statistical similarities were found, especially for what concerned aspects of the urban fabric, configurational features, and the relationship between densities of amenities and street centrality. These findings add to the studies that recognise the value of informal settlements. Furthermore, the proposed methodology can be replicated to increase the generalisability of this result and further legitimise informal urban development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

We studied the case of budget data and the two main graphic visualization tools intended to close this gap. By means of a questionnaire answered by their managers in 34 Spanish public administrations, we try to find answers to the main questions related to their adoption and use.

Despite its prominence in development cooperation discussions, many national development professionals or stakeholders have not heard of PCD, indicating that its effectiveness is significantly limited. This article contends that the impact of PCD has not been maximized because it has been presented as a political objective or a policy tool by multilateral organizations and their member states. Instead, the article argues that PCD should be implemented as a methodology that can be adopted by domestic government and non-governmental actors alike, in order to understand trade-offs and co-benefits within and between policy sectors, thus promoting a participative approach. I-GAMMA is a research project in Mexico that examines data-driven public policy in order to promote PCD. It is based on in-depth reviews of policy documents and interviews with development actors. It is committed to open data, evidence-based policymaking, and collaborative dialogue between academics, government ocials, and representatives of civil society organizations in sustainable development discussions. In the results section of this article, the project proposes participative PCD as a methodology for policy analysis through which a plurality of actors can identify mechanisms that either reinforce or undermine sustainable development strategies. This section then applies the methodology to the governance of protected natural areas in Mexico. The discussion section and the conclusions highlight the relevance of this approach for participative policymaking in sustainable development. © 2020 by the authors.},

Concepts such as open data and content, open access, free software, social construction of knowledge, etc. have been installed in the theory and practice of scientific research (open science) and administrative management (open government) to become an outstanding potential vector for the advancement of scientific knowledge, the economy based on use of data and the transparency of institutions. In the field of cultural heritage, the democratization of knowledge, social participation in public management or the rise of cultural tourism, also affect the increasingly close relationship between the academic, professional and administrative fields and these, in turn, with a population that ceases to be exclusively passive recipient of the information filtered from these areas, to become involved in many of the aspects that concern its management. In this context, archaeology shows some singularities that will be discussed in this paper, focusing on the Spanish case. For this purpose, the advances that have taken place in the generation of open archaeological contents will be reviewed, as well as the main remaining challenges. © 2021 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

Almost undisputed, the concept has gained importance in both academic and practitioners’ circles due to its strong intrinsic and/or instrumental value. Recent years have seen the emergence of the open-data movement and its growing impact on government policies. Nevertheless, evidence related to impacts on transparency remains fragmented. This study aims to contribute to the field of research on transparency and open data by providing a conceptual clarification and by showing how both concepts are related and perceived in the Swiss public administration. This allows avoiding further confusion and better understanding the relation between the two notions. Moreover, this contribution also explores the implementation of the open-data logic in Switzerland. Although it does not participate in the Open Government Partnership, an international platform of 75 governments committed to making their activities more transparent, the country launched the federal Open Government Data project in 2015 with the aim of establishing an open-data culture within the administration. However, implementation of the open-data logic has been rather halting so far. Based on in-depth interviews conducted with civil servants in Switzerland, this contribution identifies four main types of barriers that impact on the uptake of open data in Switzerland: cultural, institutional, individual and economic. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Government administrative data have enormous potential for public and individual benefit through improved educational and health services to citizens, medical research, environmental and climate interventions and better use of scarce energy resources. The purpose of this study (part of the Administrative Data Research Centre in England, ADRC-E) was to examine perspectives about the sharing, linking and re-use (secondary use) of government administrative data. This study seeks to establish an analytical understanding of risk with regard to administrative data. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study focused on the secondary use of government administrative data by academic researchers. Data collection was through 44 semi-structured interviews plus one focus group, and was supported by documentary analysis and a literature review. The study draws on the views of expert data researchers, data providers, regulatory bodies, research funders, lobby groups, information practitioners and data subjects. Findings: This study discusses the identification and management of risk in the use of government administrative data and presents a risk framework. Practical implications: This study will have resonance with records managers, risk managers, data specialists, information policy and compliance managers, citizens groups that engage with data, as well as all those responsible for the creation and management of government administrative data. Originality/value: First, this study identifies and categorizes the risks arising from the research use of government administrative data, based on policy, practice and experience of those involved. Second, it identifies mitigating risk management activities, linked to five key stakeholder communities, and it discusses the locus of responsibility for risk management actions. The conclusion presents the elements of a new risk framework to inform future actions by the government data community and enable researchers to exploit the power of administrative data for public good. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Die Nachnutzung vorhandener Daten bietet erhebliche Vorteile auf wissenschaftlicher, politischer, sozialer, kultureller und insbesondere wirtschaftlicher Ebene. Die Öffnung von Datensammlungen (Open Data) stößt sowohl im öffentlichen als auch im privaten Sektor auf gesteigertes Interesse. Dies geht auf die Bemühungen zur vermehrten Transparenz im öffentlichen Sektor und auf die Begeisterung für Big Data und Datenanalyse zurück. In den letzten Jahren haben daher immer mehr Ministerien bzw. Regierungen begonnen, ihre Daten zu veröffentlichen. Diese sogenannten Open Government- oder Open Research-Bewegungen haben zur Einführung zahlreicher Portale geführt, die eine Infrastruktur für den Zugang zu Forschungsdaten bereitstellen. Die Entwicklung dieser Infrastruktur verändert die Art, wie Forschende nach Daten zur Beschreibung ihres Forschungsgegenstandes oder nach analysierbaren Forschungsdaten suchen. Implizit geht es vor allem darum, mehr Datenaustausch und Transparenz zu erreichen, um die Öffnung weiterer Datensilos für breite Anwenderkreise voranzutreiben. Qualitätsfragen spielten dabei in der Anfangsphase eine zu geringe Rolle.

On this topic, using the semantic network analysis method, the research aims to investigate the communication structure and the governance of open data in the Twitter conversational environment. In particular, the research questions are: (1) Who are the main actors in the Italian open data infrastructure? (2) What are the main conversation topics online? (3) What are the pros and cons of the development and use (reuse) of open data in Italy? To answer these questions, we went through three research phases: (1) analysing the communication network, we found who are the main influencers; (2) once we found who were the main actors, we analysed the online content in the Twittersphere to detect the semantic areas; (3) then, through an online focus group with the main open data influencers, we explored the characteristics of Italian open data governance. Through the research, it has been shown that: (1) there is an Italian open data governance strategy; (2) the Italian civic hacker community plays an important role as an influencer; but (3) there are weaknesses in governance and in practical reuse. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Sustainable development is best supported by intersectoral policies informed by a range of evidence and knowledge types (e.g. scientific and lay). Given China’s rapid urbanisation, scale and global importance in climate mitigation, this study investigates how evidence is perceived and used to inform urban health and sustainability policies at central and local levels. Well-informed senior professionals in government/scientific agencies (12 in Beijing and 11 in Ningbo) were interviewed. A thematic analysis is presented using deductive and inductive coding. Government agency participants described formal remits and processes determining the scope and use of evidence by different tiers of government. Academic evidence was influential when commissioned by government departments. Public opinion and economic priorities were two factors that also influenced the use or weight of evidence in policymaking. This study shows that scientific evidence produced or commissioned by government was routinely used to inform urban health and sustainability policy. Extensive and routine data collection is regularly used to inform cyclical policy processes, which improves adaptive capacity. This study contributes to knowledge on the ‘cultures of evidence use’. Environmental governance can be further improved through increased data-sharing and use of diverse knowledge types. POLICY RELEVANCE • Insights are provided into the ‘cultures of evidence use’ in urban sustainability and health governance in two Chinese cities, noting the complex interconnections between national policy agendas, the public and evidence. Policies are centrally led and informed by officially commissioned scientific evidence. • Environmental health data were used for monitoring policy implementation, and they were interpreted with careful consideration of public opinion and economic priorities. • There were opportunities for local priorities to shift the policy agenda, particularly when the public became aware of a specific environmental health threat. • Environmental governance could be strengthened in these settings through increased cross-sector data-sharing and integration of diverse knowledge types. • A strength of China’s approach is routine data collection that feeds a monitoring and policy cycle rarely achieved elsewhere. This cycle provides feedback to government departments, allows policy adjustment over time and can inform decisions during crises. © 2021 The Author(s).},

If students are to navigate the turbulent waters of data and algorithms, then data literacies must be featured in academic development programmes, thereby enabling HE to lead in the development of approaches to understanding and analysing data, in order to foster reflection on how data are constructed and operationalised across societies, and provide opportunities to learn from the analysis of data from a range of sources.

The process and outcomes were assessed, leading to the lessons and development of recommendations for future health hackathons as an innovation in health care. We have found that conducting the virtual hackathon for COVID-19 resulted in significant growth in the digital health community in Sweden. Governments should be as fast as the private actors and citizens to address these challenges and to undertake organizational adaptations. Not only the hackathons, but the projects and processes after the hackathons should also be planned. Matchmaking between individuals and private and public actors should be facilitated throughout the year. Technology companies should provide platforms that facilitate flow of process with nice structures and user-friendly tools. Organizations were not ready to utilize the outcomes of these hackathons.

This article focuses on four OSBPs in East Africa and addresses the question, firstly, of how far they make a break with entrenched operational patterns within government bureaucracies, and secondly whether they represent a distinct type of border management regime? The article finds that while there has been progress on data sharing in Customs, the construction and management of OSBPs reflects the persistence of distinct institutional cultures within each country. Moreover, working practices involve practical workarounds which belie notions of a paperless border. Secondly, the article finds that OSBPs are unlike other border crossings and share some features with airports and seaports in that they have been designed to handle both cargo and people. But they differ in that they are not heavily securitized and represent co-produced spaces of interaction in which transporters and members of the surrounding community have helped to shape the organizational patterns. The outcomes fuse an official ideology of service, everyday bureaucratic practice and local understandings of ownership. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

We argue that open government data are a strategic resource of organizations and therefore organizations are not likely to share it. We develop an analytical framework for studying the politics of open government data, based on theories of strategic responses to institutional processes, government transparency, and open government data. The framework shows that there can be different organizational strategic responses to open data—varying from conformity to active resistance—and that different institutional antecedents influence these responses. The value of the framework is explored in two cases: a province in the Netherlands and a municipality in France. The cases provide insights into why governments might release datasets in certain policy domains but not in others thereby producing “strategically opaque transparency.” The article concludes that the politics of open government data framework helps us understand open data practices in relation to broader institutional pressures that influence government transparency. © The Author(s) 2019.},

Big Data in health care has its own features, such as heterogeneity, incompleteness, timeliness and longevity, privacy, and ownership. These features bring a series of challenges for data storage, mining, and sharing to promote health-related research. To deal with these challenges, analysis approaches focusing on Big Data in health care need to be developed and laws and regulations for making use of Big Data in health care need to be enacted. From a patient perspective, application of Big Data analysis could bring about improved treatment and lower costs. In addition to patients, government, hospitals, and research institutions could also benefit from the Big Data in health care. © 2019 © 2018 Liang Hong et al., published by Sciendo},

How data sharing and linkage is framed is important, and attitudes about data sharing and linkage are driven by respondents' privacy beliefs and views towards the government more generally. Using data from the RDD telephone Gallup Daily Tracking Survey, we examine how favorability towards data sharing for the purpose of informed decision-making compares to other purposes. Respondents were less favorable towards data sharing when the purpose was for informed decision-making than for efficient use of taxpayer money, government accountability, or for community benefits, suggesting this is an ineffective way to frame data sharing to increase support. However, views towards the government, beliefs about privacy, and response behavior are still important determinants of favorability. © 2019 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Association for Public Opinion Research 2019.},

However, as open data has grown, a critical literature has also emerged which questions who the true beneficiaries of open data are, as well as highlighting the high costs it places on government. Hence systematic research on the actual outcomes of open data projects is urgently needed. This article seeks to explain the factors which promote greater levels of downloads of open government data. We show that the use of profit making datasets far exceeds those which could be used to enhance government transparency or service delivery. We also show that well updated datasets with high quality metadata are more likely to be downloaded. We conclude by supporting currently developing calls for prioritisation in open government data programmes. Copyright © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

The evaluation allowed judgement that Social Security not only complies with the laws and regulations stipulated for the publication of the open data, but also applies good practices. Although the degree of Open Data Transparency, a partially satisfactory result was found, indicating the need to remedy deficiencies, both in data sets and in the site. It was also evaluated that the Open Data published by the institution are relevant and satisfy the information needs of the citizens, but the experts emphasized that because Social Security has a database full of important information, actions must be taken for the expansion of its datasets in the Portal dados.gov.br. © 2019 Fundacao Cesgranrio.

	abstract = {Government departments and agencies around the world routinely collect administrative data produced by citizen interaction with the state. The UK government increasingly frames data as an ‘asset’. The potential in administrative data can be exploited by sharing and linking across datasets, but when the rhetoric of the benefits of data sharing is bound up in commercial exploitation, trustworthy motivations for sharing data come into question. Such questions are framed around two apparently conflicting public goods. The public good in re-using data to increase government efficiency and to enhance research is set against the public good in protecting privacy. Privacy is a collective as well as an individual benefit, enabling the public to participate confidently in citizen-state interactions. Balancing these public goods is challenging given rapidly evolving technology and data science. The analysis presented here draws on research undertaken by the authors as part of the Administrative Data Research Centre in England. Between 2014 and 2017, four case studies were conducted on government administrative data across education, transport, energy and health. The purpose of the research was to examine stakeholder perspectives in relation to administrative data sharing and re-use. The themes of trust, risk and consent were chosen to articulate the research questions and analysis: this article focuses on the findings related to trust. It explores the notion of trust in the collection, analysis, linkage and re-use of routinely collected government administrative data in England. It seeks to demonstrate that securing public trust in data initiatives is dependent on a broader balance of trust between a network of actors involved in data sharing and use. © 2017, The Author(s).},

They are called “data collaboratives”. Data collaboratives are seen as a novel way to match real life problems with relevant expertise and data from across the sectors. Despite its significance and growing experimentation by practitioners, there has been limited research in this field. In this article, the authors report on the outcomes of a panel discussing critical issues facing data collaboratives and develop a research and development agenda. The panel included participants from the government, academics, and practitioners and was held in June 2017 during the 18 th International Conference on Digital Government Research at City University of New York (Staten Island, New York, USA). The article begins by discussing the concept of data collaboratives. Then the authors formulate research questions and topics for the research roadmap based on the panel discussions. The research roadmap poses questions across nine different topics: conceptualizing data collaboratives, value of data, matching data to problems, impact analysis, incentives, capabilities, governance, data management, and interoperability. Finally, the authors discuss how digital government research can contribute to answering some of the identified research questions. Copyright © 2018, IGI Global.},

It facilitates efficient sharing of data, supports new business models, and is thus a key enabler for the digital economy, open research, societal collaboration and political processes. While several European countries have taken steps to set up data infrastructures cutting across institutional silos, approaches vary, and there is no common understanding of what a NDI exactly comprises. In Switzerland, activities are still at a conceptual stage. In order to foster a shared vision of what a NDI is about, stakeholder interviews were carried out with representatives of public administration, research, civil society, and the private sector. There is broad consensus among key stakeholders that a NDI is to be conceived as a nationwide distributed technical infrastructure allowing the sharing of data, based on predefined rules. Our findings also suggest that the notion of a NDI should be approached from four perspectives: A big data, a base register, an open data, and a mydata perspective. For its implementation, effective coordination across several dimensions (ethical, legal, political, economical, organizational, semantical, and technical) is crucial, which calls for a truly multidisciplinary approach. © 2018-IOS Press and the authors.

Thus, during the past few years, governments around the world have been under increasing pressure to release data to encourage citizen participation in government. In the UK, the government publishes its data on the data.gov.uk website for the public to find, view, download and interrogate. In this paper, we evaluate the extent of openness of OGD in the UK – a recognised global leader in the OGD movement – by examining a sample of 400 datasets listed on this website. The examination uses an ‘ordinary citizen’ test, which is developed based on the original eight Sebastopol principles of open data. Our examination discovers that existing prevalent measures of openness of data are inadequate. Our findings demonstrate that the majority of the published government resources on the website are informational rather than granular data. In fact, only a small minority of these advertised as open data are actually open, which severely limits their open government utilities. © 2019},

Our first field of application focuses on the French Pyrenees. In order to achieve our goal, we worked on two fronts: (i) the ability to export this data from their original databases and data models to well-known open data platforms; and (ii) the proposition of an open-source algorithm and framework capable of recommending a sequence of cultural heritage points of interests (POIs) to be visited by tourists. This itinerary recommendation approach is original in many aspects: it not only considers the user preferences and popularity of POIs, but it also integrates different contextual information about the user as well as the relevance of specific sequences of POIs (strong links between POIs). The ability to export the cultural heritage data as open data and to recommend sequences of POIs are being integrated in a first prototype. © 2019 by the authors.},

Design/methodology/approach: The paper evaluates data walks as a method for engaging non-tech-savvy citizens in co-design work. These were evaluated along a framework considering how such interventions allow for sharing control (e.g. over design decisions), sharing expertise and enabling change. Findings: Within a co-creation project, different types of data walks may be conducted, including ideation walks, data co-creation walks or user test walks. These complement each other with respect to how they facilitate the sharing of control and expertise, and enable change for a variety of older citizens. Practical implications: Data walks are a method with a low-threshold, potentially enabling a variety of citizens to engage in co-design activities relating to open government and civic tech. Social implications: Such methods address the digital divide and further social participation of non-tech-savvy citizens. They value the resources and expertise of older adults as co-designers and partners, and counter stereotypical ideas about age and ageing.

Further, a systematic adoption of open and standardized APIs by firms and developers appears crucial to unlock competition and ultimately promote the flourishing of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) innovation. Analysing the main European regulatory initiatives which have so far surfaced in the realm of data governance (right to personal data portability, free flow of non-personal data, access to customer account data rule, re-use of government data), it seems that the EU legislator is not tackling the matter consistently. Indeed, on one side, all these initiatives share a strong reliance on APIs as a key facilitator to ensure a sound and effective data sharing ecosystem. However, on the other side, all these attempts are inherently different in terms of rationale, scope and implementation. The article stresses that data sharing via APIs requires a complex implementation process and sound standardization initiatives are essential for its success. Moreover, data pooling agreements need to be targeted in advance by competition law so to incentivize their adoption and leverage their pro-competitive potential. As for pricing and compensation issues, we point out that placing excessive reliance on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms might be counterproductive. © 2019 Oscar Borgogno and Giuseppe Colangelo},

Analysis of significant policy documents reveals three interrelated discourses that are engaged within England's digital health policies: equity as a neoliberal imaginary of digital efficiency and empowerment; digital health as a pathway towards democratising health care through data-sharing, co-creation and collaboration; and finally, digital health as a route towards extending citizen autonomy through their access to data systems. It advances knowledge of the relationship between digital health policy and health inequalities. Revealing that while inclusion remains a priority area for policymakers, equity is being constituted in ways that reflect broader discourses of neoliberalism, empowerment and the turn to the market for technological solutionism, which may potentially exacerbate health inequalities.

	abstract = {Public administrations publish open data for later reuse by citizens. Besides the obvious impact on transparency, they have an important economic potential which explains the increasing adoption of this type of initiatives. There is an increasing number of administrations that decide to create open data portals, a tendency that municipalities have followed. Few empirical papers have assessed this type of portals and the analyses have been mainly qualitative or limited to a reduced number of portals, so there are no generally accepted criteria for the assessment of their implementation. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of a method to analyse open data portals and its application to a sample of municipalities of Spain, a country at the forefront of data re-utilization in Europe. Furthermore, the econo-mic-financial information available in these portals is analysed, as it is essential to accountability, fight corruption and evaluate the financial sustainability and effectiveness of public service delivery. Results show that there is much room for improvement in this field. Only 40\% of the cities analysed have an open data portal, and the average score of the sample analysed does not reach 50\%. Most portals seem to work as mere data repositories, neglecting those aspects that promote data use by the non-expert public, accountability, citizen engagement and the quality of the data being disclosed (e.g., definition of the metadata used). So, the paper concludes with some recommendations for improvement. © 2019, El Profesional de la Informacion. All rights reserved.},

The paper discusses how the new “hard” digital infrastructures such as broadband are accompanied by the need to understand the governance of public sector information; and in turn how this relates to the emergence of smart city strategies. The paper is illustrated using empirical examples drawn from Australian digital infrastructure development, with reference to the international landscape of “smart city” developments. It argues that there is a significant mismatch between the often small scale, bounded capabilities of municipal government, and the operational expertise and scope of technology firms. © 2016 Editorial Board, Urban Policy and Research.},

The overall objective was subdivided into three specific objectives: (1) Identify the countries of Latin America that have defined access to information/open data policy legislation; (2) Identify the most comprehensive legislation and criteria for assessing open government data; and (3) Analyze the DGABr based on other legislation and propose adjustments for its use in other countries. In this sense, the legislation on access to information of Latin American countries was investigated, based on the Global Right to Information Rating ranking, which assesses legislation on access to information worldwide. The legislation of Mexico was chosen as reference for comparison with the DGABr, having reached in the ranking, the highest score in Latin America. Analyzing Mexican legislation, items to be included in the DGABr were identified and many similarities were already evaluated by the DGABr. It is concluded that the DGABr allows adaptations and can be used in different contexts and countries of Latin America. © 2019 Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Campinas. All rights reserved.},

We have built an open-source tool, BOAT (Big Data Open Source Analytics Tool, https://github.com/fdudatamining) to facilitate analytical exploration of open health data sets. We used BOAT to analyze data from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System and determined that there has been a significant increase (40 percent) in the incidences of mental health issues amongst adolescents from 2009–2014. We analyzed costs for hip replacement surgery for 168,676 patients is in New York State, and showed that 88\% of these patients had surgery costs of less than 30,000. This figure helps in understanding the decision by The California Public Employees’ Retirement System to cap hip replacement reimbursements at 30,000, resulting in significant savings.

	abstract = {Open government data (open data) initiatives have been at the forefront of the strategy to make more transparent, responsive, and accountable government, and thereby lead to open innovation across the public and private sector. Governments around the world often understand that open data is disclosing their data to the public as much as possible and that open data success is the result of a data and technology-related endeavor rather than the result of organizational, institutional, and environmental attributes. According to the resource-based theory, however, managerial capability to mobilize tangible and intangible resources and deploy them in adequate places or processes under the leadership of capable leaders during the information technology (IT) project is a core factor leading to organizational performance such as open data success. In this vein, this study aims to analyze managerial factors as drivers and challenges of open data success from the resource-based theory. Findings illustrate that managerial factors are the driving forces that often boost or hinder open data success when institutional, socio-economic, and demographic factors are controlled. Discussion illustrates theoretical and practical implications for the managerial factors as drivers and challenges of open data success in terms of the comparison between technological determinism and the socio-technical perspective. © 2019 by the authors.

E-government, for example, have to manage accurate and complete metadata information to guarantee the reliability and foster the reputation of e-government to the public. Measuring and comparing the quality of open data is not a straightforward process because it implies to take into consideration multiple quality dimensions whose quality may vary from one another, as well as various open data stakeholders who – depending on their role/needs – may have different preferences regarding the dimensions’ importance. To address this Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem, and since data quality is hardly considered in existing e-government models, this paper develops an Open Data Portal Quality (ODPQ) framework that enables end-users to easily and in real-time assess/rank open data portals. From a theoretical standpoint, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to integrate various data quality dimensions and end-user preferences. From a practical standpoint, the proposed framework is used to compare over 250 open data portals, powered by organizations across 43 different countries. The findings of our study reveals that today's organizations do not pay sufficient heed to the management of datasets, resources and associated metadata that they are currently publishing on their portal. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

We systematically compare the open data inception and implementation processes, as well as their main results, in three Spanish local governments (Gava and Rubi in Catalonia and Gijon in Asturias) by using a model that combines the technology enactment framework with some specific constructs and relationships from the process model of computing change. Our resulting model is able to identify and explain the significant role of management in shaping and mediating different interactions, but also acknowledges the importance of organizational level variables and the context in which the open data initiative is taking place. © 2018, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

	abstract = {Drawing on a two-year ethnographic study within several French administrations involved in open data programs, this article aims to investigate the conditions of the release of government data – the rawness of which open data policies require. This article describes two sets of phenomena. First, far from being taken for granted, open data emerge in administrations through a progressive process that entails uncertain collective inquiries and extraction work. Second, the opening process draws on a series of transformations, as data are modified to satisfy an important criterion of open data policies: the need for both human and technical intelligibility. There are organizational consequences of these two points, which can notably lead to the visibilization or the invisibilization of data labour. Finally, the article invites us to reconsider the apparent contradiction between the process of data release and the existence of raw data. Echoing the vocabulary of one of the interviewees, the multiple operations can be seen as a ‘rawification’ process by which open government data are carefully generated. Such a notion notably helps to build a relational model of what counts as data and what counts as work. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

This is supported by governmental decisions and policies that are boosting the open data wave, and in this context archaeology is also affected by this new trend. In many countries, archaeological data are still protected or only limited access is allowed. However, the strong political and economic support for the publication of government data as open data will change the accessibility and disciplinary expertise in the archaeological field too. In order to maximize the impact of data, their technical openness is of primary importance. Indeed, since a spreadsheet is more usable than a PDF of a table, the availability of digital archaeological data, which is structured using standardised approaches, is of primary importance for the real usability of published data. In this context, the main aim of this paper is to present a workflow for archaeological data sharing as open data with a large level of technical usability and interoperability. Primary data is mainly acquired through the use of digital techniques (e.g. digital cameras and terrestrial laser scanning). The processing of this raw data is performed with commercial software for scan registration and image processing, allowing for a simple and semi-automated workflow. Outputs obtained from this step are then processed in modelling and drawing environments to generate digital models, both 2D and 3D. These crude geometrical data are then enriched with further information to generate a Geographic Information System (GIS) which is finally published as open data using Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards to maximise interoperability. © UPV, SEAV, 2015.; El paradigma de los datos abiertos está cambiando el enfoque de investigación en muchos campos de estudio como son la teledetección y las ciencias sociales. Está respaldado por decisiones gubernamentales y políticas que están impulsando la ola de los datos abiertos y en este contexto también la arqueología se ve afectada por esta nueva tendencia. En muchos países, los datos arqueológicos todavía están protegidos o se permite un acceso limitado. Sin embargo, el fuerte apoyo político y económico hacia la publicación de datos gubernamentales como datos abiertos también cambiará el panorama en el campo arqueológico. Para maximizar el efecto de los datos, su apertura técnica es de primordial importancia. De hecho, dado que una hoja de cálculo es más útil que la digitalización PDF de una tabla, de manera similar, la disponibilidad de los datos arqueológicos digitales y su estructuración mediante enfoques estandarizados es de importancia primordial para una utilización real de los datos publicados. En este contexto, el objetivo principal de este documento es presentar un flujo de trabajo para compartir datos arqueológicos como datos abiertos con un gran nivel de usabilidad técnica e interoperabilidad. La adquisición de datos primarios se realiza principalmente mediante el uso de técnicas de adquisición digital (por ejemplo, cámaras digitales y escaneado láser terrestre). El procesamiento de los datos crudos se realiza con software comercial para el registro de los escaneados y el procesamiento de imágenes que permite un procesamiento simple y semiautomático. Los resultados del área arqueológica obtenidos de este paso se procesan en modelos y entornos de dibujo que permiten generar modelos digitales, 2D y 3D. Esos datos geométricos crudos se enriquecen luego con información adicional para generar un Sistema de Información Geográfica (SIG) que finalmente se publica con datos abiertos usando los estándares del Consorcio Geoespacial Abierto (OGC) que maximizan la interoperabilidad. © UPV, SEAV, 2015.},

	abstract = {Governments around the world make their data available through platforms but, disappointingly, the use of this data is lagging behind. This problem has been recognized in the literature and to facilitate use of open datasets, scholars have focused on identifying general user requirements for open data platform design. This approach however fails to take into account the variation of open data practices and specific contexts of usage. This study, therefore, argues that next to general requirements: we also need to collect context-specific user requirements for open data platforms. We take different societal issues as the starting point for open data platform design. To illustrate the value of this context-specific approach, we apply scenario-based design methodology in the Province of Groningen in The Netherlands. The results show that different scenarios result partly in similar but also partly in different user requirements, leading to a deeper and richer understanding of user requirements. We conclude that a context-specific approach thereby connecting data, users and societal issues can be used to guide government agencies and designers in efforts to develop open data platforms that actually meet the needs of citizens. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

Integrating new-generation information and communications technologies, including the Internet of Things data collection, cloud computation, big data applications, and mobile network, smart cities organize the people and things of a city according to application needs to perform real-time computation and processing. Information transmission must be rapid and reliable to protect personal privacy and to secure data. All types of information security problems can lead to disastrous consequences; in particular, they pose great challenges to traditional information security systems. To explore possible solutions to the challenges that Taiwan's smart city information security faces, this study used the enterprise architecture method and discussed the emphasis and investment capacity of the government and enterprises on information security. Moreover, this study reviewed correct methods of using a smart information security collaborative system to protect not only privacy, however also networks with a large attack surface; the purpose was to establish a reliable data sharing practice and alleviate the cascading effect of failures of smart networks. Finally, this paper provides future research directions for building smart cities and encouraging further explorations in this domain. It is hoped that smart cities can conduct overall planning for information security during the process of construction. Future researchers will be able to propose more effective solutions for smart city information security while developing information and communication technologies. © 2018 by the authors.},

The basic and transversal themes are data sharing and public sector information. As for the emerging themes, these are Big Data and open government data. In addition, data journalism, monitoring, and recommender systems are specific themes that deserve special attention. The UK and the USA are the leading publishing countries, both in theoretical and practical research on open data. In China, most researchers focus on practical research, and there have been efforts to promote the development of open data.

Meanwhile, many remarkable achievements with open data and big data have been applied in urban research, but rare to urban waterlogging research. Taking Xiamen city in China as a case, this study aims to analyze spatial-temporal distribution of waterlogging and assess waterlogging risk of each district in the city. Risk assessment model was built by considering both population and urban public facilities, which acquired from coupling urban internet open data and field investigation. Then we analyzed the government management efficiency through comparison of urban government management plan and waterlogging information from internet.

The goal of this research was to engage members of a local food community and generate volunteered geographic information (VGI) on community food assets. During active data collection, over 200 food assets were reported. This paper details the systematic approach used to create VGI, which emphasizes the socio-cultural context surrounding the mapping technology. The project began with an identified need to connect to and learn from the local food community. The participants were drawn from active food system stakeholders, and a Geoweb infrastructure was selected based on publicly available crowdsourcing tools. The resulting VGI is presented according to system functions: input (Web traffic, contributors, input types), management (contribution vetting, privacy), analysis (typology of input), and presentation (sharing the submitted data). Despite limitations, this study revealed a hyper-local and community-driven perspective on food assets, opened access to government and private data, and increased the transparency and accessibility of information on the regional food system. This research also revealed that there is a growing need for intermediaries who can bridge the gap between experts in the subject matter and experts in digitally enabled participation, and a need for non-government open data repositories. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

This construct, called DECIDE, was based on four indicators related to administrative burden reduction, democracy, institutional quality and open government data, represented respectively by Global Open Data Index, Democracy Index, Ease of doing Business Raking, and Institutional Quality Index. These four indicators were analysed with the Corruption Perception Index (CPI). A database was created that was analyzed following all the requirements of the technique Partial Least Squares (PLS). The main result was the creation of DECIDE, which explains 50\% of the CPI's perception of corruption during these years. The DECIDE, in turn, is explained by the four indicators. This construct provides a foundation for the context to be less conducive to corruption while broadening protection mechanisms. In practical terms, the study identifies that a less bureaucratic, more democratic, more transparent country where institutions work best is more protected from corruption, whereas these four variables act as a deterrent to corruption. © 2019 FEA-RP/USP.

Five different dimensions should be distinguished: policy and strategy, legislative foundations, organizational arrangements, relevant skills, public support and awareness. The approach to the institutional dimensions differs between the countries. Centralized OGD governance is shown to yield better results and a higher level of OGD implementation.

Advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) continue to have an impact on the ways that policy-makers and citizens engage with each other throughout the policy-making process. A set of developments in the areas of opening government data, advanced analytics, visualization, simulation, and gaming, and ubiquitous citizen access using mobile and personalized applications is shaping the interactions between policy-makers and citizens. Yet the impact of these developments on the policy-makers is unclear. The changing roles and need for new capabilities required from the government are analyzed in this paper using two case studies. Salient new roles for policy-makers are outlined focused on orchestrating the policy-making process. Research directions are identified including understand the behavior of users, aggregating and analyzing content from scattered resources, and the effective use of the new tools. Understanding new policy-makers roles will help to bridge the gap between the potential of tools and technologies and the organizational realities and political contexts.

Metadata are a key concept for the description and classification of data and thus also for ensuring their long-term value. We analyze the European Data Portal as well as one national metadatabase (Austrian Data Portal) with regard to aspects such as data search functionality, keyword consistency, spatial referencing, data format and data license information.

The release of such area based lending data has been welcomed by advocacy groups and policy makers keen to better understand and remedy geographies of financial exclusion. This paper makes three contributions to debates about financial exclusion. First, it provides the first exploratory spatial analysis of the personal lending data made available; it scrutinises the parameters and robustness of the dataset and evaluates the extent to which the data increase transparency in UK personal lending markets. Second, it uses the data to provide a geographical overview of patterns of personal lending across Great Britain. Third, it uses this analysis to revisit the analytical and political limitations of ‘open data’ in addressing the relationship between access to finance and economic marginalisation. Although a binary policy imaginary of ‘inclusion-exclusion’ has historically driven advocacy for data disclosure, recent literatures on financial exclusion generate the need for more complex and variegated understandings of economic marginalisation. The paper questions the relationship between transparency and data disclosure, the policy push for financial inclusion, and patterns of indebtedness and economic marginalisation in a world where ‘fringe finance’ has become mainstream. Drawing on these literatures, this analysis suggests that data disclosure, and the transparency it affords, is a necessary but not sufficient tool in understanding the distributional implications of variegated access to credit. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

	abstract = {Open data initiatives are a crucial aspect of effective e-governance strategy. They embody aspirations towards sociopolitical values of transparency, trust, confidence, and accountability, pertaining to the relationship between a government and its citizens. The importance of such initiatives is especially important for an emerging economy such as Saudi Arabia which is undergoing rapid social changes directed by a contemporary national vision. The effectiveness of open data initiatives depends strongly on (a) the quality of the data available, (b) the soundness of the methodologies and suitability of platforms used to prepare and present the data, and (c) the ability of the data to facilitate the kinds of insights and social-action that are sought from that data to ensure successful e-governance. This paper investigates the feasibility of current Saudi government open data initiatives in this regard. It assesses existing approaches to improve the effectiveness of open government data through transforming it into linked-open data (using the Resource Description Framework [RDF]) by connecting disparate sources of structured data therein. It proposes to improve existing approaches by suggesting a framework for automating the linking sub-process of existing approaches and organizing the data to be queried through SPARQL. Moreover, it evaluates the potential benefit of this proposal by discussing the kinds of policy insights this could generate which would be difficult without it. © 2019 MECS.},

	abstract = {Over the past 10 years, we have observed a significant growth in open data adoption in governments across the globe. Potential barriers and enablers of open government data have been well-documented in the literature. However, nearly all of this research has been conducted in Western, democratic and developed societies, with very little known about open government data implementation in less developed countries. This article investigates how institutional dimensions affect open data implementation in six understudied countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. This research presents rich data based on an analysis of 31 documents and focus group discussions with a total of 89 participants. In general, we find that in these countries the same institutional dimensions influence OGD implementation as in their Western counterparts. A striking difference, however, is that we find open data implementation in transition countries to be much more fragile and highly dependent on foreign aid initiatives. This paper also strengthens the argument that institutional dimensions explain the performance of open data implementation. © 2020 The Author(s).

Uber’s tenacious and highly competitive approach to building markets is identified as a significant challenge to authorities and the limited power they have over Uber (beyond simply refusing access) is acknowledged. Uber’s entry into the delivery of statutory services is identified as a particularly striking development. The case of Uber provides useful insights concerning technological innovation and disruption, but more important is the company’s business model. The analysis enables some findings concerning how authorities can prepare for the “next” Uber: these include working on preparedness (by conducting futures work, for example); on standing arrangements (such as insisting on an open data model); and on responding to the entry of a challenging provider or service, through the use of experimental legislation. © 2018, The Author(s).},

Seven cases presenting different modes of researcher support for open data analysis were investigated and compared. Four types of support were identified: 1) ‘Figure it out yourself’, 2) ‘Leading users by the hand’, 3) ‘Training to provide the basics’ and 4) ‘Learning from peers’.

During the first phase of the WSDP (2007 to 2014), implementing agencies developed information systems for attaining management efficiencies. One of these systems, the Water Point Mapping System (WPMS), has now been completed, and the database is openly available to the public, as part of the country's commitment to the Open Government Partnership (OGP) initiative. The Tanzanian WPMS project was the first attempt to map "wall-to-wall" all rural public water points in an African nation. The complexity of the endeavor led to suboptimal results in the quality of the WPMS database, the baseline of the WPMS. The WPMS database was a means for the future monitoring of all rural water points, but its construction has become an end in itself. We trace the challenges of water point mapping in Tanzania and describe how the WPMS database was initially populated and to what effect. The paper conceptualizes errors found in the WPMS database as material, observational, conceptual and discursive, and characterizes them in terms of type, suspected origin and mitigation options. The discussion focuses on the consequences of open data scrutiny for the integrity of the WPMS database and the implications for monitoring wicked water point data. © 2017 by the authors.},

However, the use of open data and its consequent societal value has proved not to be as extensive as initially hoped for, although multiple innovations have emerged; rather it is still considered problematic, and knowledge about open data use is scarce. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to clarify open data use and engagement by people outside the public sector, especially what motives exists and how different user types align to these motives. To achieve this, a document analysis has been carried out of reported use cases identified in EU topic reports between 2014 and 2016. By applying the theory of Relevant Social Groups (RSG), which focuses on the people's interpretation of the purpose with the technology, we identified five RSGs representing overall motives for open data use: 1) Exploring for creativity, 2) Creating business value, 3) Enabling local citizen value, 4) Addressing global societal challenges, and 5) Advocating the open data agenda. We also discuss differences between the relevant social groups and the included user types, issues and implications for understanding the evolvement of the open data field, and suggests research ahead. © 2018 The Authors},

A sample of 721 publications was conducted through a combination of bibliometric analysis and systematic review, which revealed the characteristics and the nascent state of literature. This was followed by an exploratory Case Study, conducted through in-depth interviews and participant observation and supplemented by secondary materials. The content of the Case Study was extensively and systematically analysed through textual coding.

	abstract = {For about ten years, governments have been experimenting with ‘open government’ and ‘open data’. Stimulating a transparent and open government by publishing data is thought to be a new phase in the democratization and emancipation of citizens. Open data enthusiasts (sometimes) argue that these advantages are to be achieved through the dissemination of data to ‘intermediaries’, and not necessarily to the average citizen. Groups like journalists, data-analysts and activists are considered to be the pathways through which governmental data is and should be transformed into information and communicated to the public. Within the legal environment of access to government information, the notion that intermediaries have a more pressing claim to government information seems to allow for an analogy to the so-called ‘public watchdog’ approach the ECtHR has taken under article 10, related to freedom of expression. Article 10’s remit can cover a limited right to information, but only for those performing this watchdog function. However, in many of the laws dealing more directly with government information, the implicit or explicit criterion is that ‘anyone’ has the same access in principle. In this essay, we analyse the role and function(ing) of intermediaries in the context of Dutch open data policy from two different perspectives. In our legal analysis, we explore the linkages between various international levels touching upon a right to information and Dutch open data policy. From the perspective of political philosophy, we question the distinction drawn between intermediaries and the public, in terms of data and information dissemination. To what extent does it make sense to differentiate between citizens on the basis of their function or job? What is the moral difference between a journalist and a citizen in this respect? The expectations of access to government information are sky-high. To what extent are we subcontracting them?. © 2019, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro. All rights reserved.},

However, little is known about how it is developing that path, if it is really generating its own characteristics and what its scope is in terms of the creation of an academic community. This article conducts a systematic review or meta-evaluation of the literature on OG for 5 years (2011 to 2015) from the three magazines most recognized for their production and quality of content on the theme: Government Information Quarterly, Information Polity and eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government. This article analyzes 189 articles, classified into different categories that try to answer three research questions: How is the OG analyzed? (Study Design, Research Techniques, Methodological Approach) Where is the OG analyzed? (University Departments, Host Country of the Universities and Institutions, Level of Government, Analyzed Country/Areas) What are the most analyzed topics and the most prominent concepts in the study of OG? (Main Topic, Keywords). Article data reveal the key features of OG analysis: few quantitative and explicative-correlational studies, a strong focus on the countries of the Anglo-American area, and very diverse interests ranging from open data, e-government and social media to co-production. In addition, it can be established to what extent a scientific community around OG has been created. Some conclusions about the development of OG in coming years are made. © 2018, Department for E-Governance and Administration. All rights reserved.},

The changing technological landscape makes it possible to digitally store data, creating opportunity to both share and reuse data anywhere in the world for later use. This movement is growing rapidly and becoming widely accepted as publicly funded agencies are mandating that researchers open their research data for sharing and reuse. While there are numerous advantages to use of open data, such as facilitating accountability and transparency, not all data are created equally. Accordingly, reusing data in qualitative research present some epistemological, methodological, legal, and ethical issues that must be addressed in the movement toward open data. We examine some of these challenges and make a case that some qualitative research data should not be reused in secondary analysis. © The Author(s) 2019.},

Transparency of the public sector is still widely seen as the main outcome of these efforts. Such a simplistic view, however, misses the rich variety of innovations resulting from open data use. We conceptualize these innovation outcomes across two dimensions: internal/external and product/process. Interviews with 15 city managers in the U.S. who are responsible for the implementation of open data policies were conducted to compare policy intentions, perceived innovation outcomes as well as actual ones. The findings show that product-centric outcomes are predominant and relate mainly to external innovation, including applications, websites and new services. Process-centric outcomes constitute rather internal innovation, such as procedural changes and the revival of innovation culture in government. We close with a set of recommendations for open data efforts in government that include structural, procedural, as well as cultural changes for successful open data initiatives. © 2018 The Authors},

All levels of the United States government are working hard to promote open data and its portals. However, there is still a lack of studies on local-level OGD portals in the United States, particularly on the quality of metadata adopted by these portals. By examining 200 US cities, a list of 112 local-level portals is sampled and we investigate the current usages of open data platforms for building local-level OGD portals. This study further investigates and discusses the adoption and potential issues of metadata on those OGD portals. Our result findings discuss the platform distributions among US local-level OGD portals, and also highlight several critical issues associated with metadata on the portals. We anticipate the results will inspire further studies on identifying solutions to improve the metadata and enhance the usability of open government data portals.

In the UK, this has resulted in the introduction of key legislation, such as the Freedom of Information Act 2010, and the Data Protection Act 2018. However, there is insufficient empirical knowledge and evidence to support the extent as to which the intended possibilities of OGD (transparency, releasing social and commercial value, and participation and engagement) have been realized. This article investigates these supposed possibilities and suggests that they may be impossibilities instead. IMPACT: Open government data has long been widely heralded as a mechanism to underpin policy-making, improve citizen engagement, and stimulate innovation. Despite the wealth of literature disputing these aspects individually, this article challenges the perceived benefits collectively against a backdrop of changing political climate and policy. The authors challenge three perceived benefits surrounding the production, consumption and publication of open government data and provide additional considerations that can be made to increase the efficiency and impact of open government data. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

While previous studies have detailed a large number of such barriers, little is known of how different types of OGD users are affected, and when the barriers appear in their innovation processes. To this end, this paper describes a case study of distributed service development in the Swedish public transport sector. The contribution to extant research is twofold. Firstly, based on an inductive analysis, three OGD user archetypes are proposed: employees, entrepreneurs and hobbyists. Secondly, the study finds that the significance of distinct innovation barriers varies across phases of the services' lifecycles and depending on the OGD users' motivation, objective, pre-conditions and approach. Drawing on these insights, we propose that OGD initiatives aimed at facilitating outbound OI to a greater extent should address the barriers that appear during diffusion of innovations, the barriers that are not directly related to the OGD provision, and the barriers that are experienced by non-obvious OGD user groups. © 2018-IOS Press and the authors.

Adopting an instruments perspective, the article identifies four characteristics of digital era policy design before detailing three issues that must be addressed to ascertain the promise and pitfalls of digital era policy design. First, we argue that scholars and practitioners alike must investigate how traditional constraints on the ideal of rational, evidence-driven policy design—long acknowledged in the “analogue design” literature—will fade or be exacerbated in the digital age. The article next confronts the reality that new digital designs and instruments will rarely emerge in a policy vacuum, but rather will be layered onto existing policy designs and complex policy mixes with sticky legacies that will be more or less amenable to digital design approaches. Finally, the article argues that while scholars and practitioners have been quick to presume that the digital age will foster a more collaborative model of state-to-non-state cooperation, digital era policy design may ultimately marginalize or eliminate citizens altogether from the design process, raising important questions about the as of yet little understood democratic implications of digital era policy design. © The Institute of Public Administration of Canada/L'Institut d'administration publique du Canada 2017},

We used age and sex-segregated data on the number of accidental deaths by unnatural causes released by Government of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy. Various extreme weather events were grouped into five broad categories: cold wave, extreme precipitation, heat wave, lightning, and tropical cyclone. During 2001–14, 25\% of all accidental deaths due to unnatural causes happened as a result of extreme weather events. Deaths due to extreme precipitation and tropical cyclones declined over time, whereas increasing trend was observed for lightning, and extreme temperature conditions. Most of the extreme weather event induced deaths were due to lightning, followed by extreme precipitation and temperature extremes. The burden of death was highest in the central part of India. States of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal were affected the most by extreme weather events. More males and older population died than their counterparts. Findings suggest that people are adaptive to some extreme weather events such as cold wave and cyclones; whereas adaptation and coping with the heat wave and extreme precipitation seems to be less. Building awareness on the adaptive mechanisms to different extremes and a community-centered alert system can help in reducing fatalities due to extreme weather events. © 2018},

This research proposes four models that can define how government accepts direct edits and feedback on geospatial data. The four models are a “status quo” of open data provision, data curation, data mirroring, and crowdsourcing. These models are placed on a continuum of government control ranging from high levels of control over data creation to a low level of control. Each model is discussed, with relevant challenges highlighted. These four models present an initial suite of options for governments looking to accept direct edits from data end users and can be framed as a partial realization of many of the principles of open government. Despite the varied potential of these approaches, they generate a shift in locus of control away from government, creating several areas of risk for government. Of these models, near-term interest may focus on data curation and data mirroring as evolutionary, rather than revolutionary steps that expand on the simple provision of open data. © 2016 The Author(s).

The present article traces how these transformations have been anticipated by successive generations of e-government maturity models and critically assesses existing stage models. Based on a survey among 1560 heritage institutions in 11 countries, an empirically validated maturity model for the implementation of open government is presented. The model uses innovation diffusion theory as a theoretical backdrop. While the model is at odds with the unidimensional nature of the Lee \& Kwak Open Government Maturity Model (Lee \& Kwak, 2012), the findings suggest that the transformative processes predicted by various e-government maturity models are well at work. They result in increasingly integrated services, participative approaches and an emerging collaborative culture, accompanied by a break-up of proprietary data silos and their replacement by a commonly shared data infrastructure, allowing data to be freely shared, inter-linked and re-used. In order to put our findings into perspective, we take stock of earlier discussions and criticisms of e-government maturity models and offer a new take on the issue of stages-of-growth models in the field of e-government. The proposed approach rests on the assumption of an evolutionary model that is empirically grounded and allows for varying development paths. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

The article also shows the results of a survey about coproduction, focused on the urban area, seeking to identify the feasibility to implement a data sharing service, using the Wi-Fi of individuals and households in areas where the local government has difficulties in offering public services. The use of this shared infrastructure would allow coproducing public services, including preventive telemedicine services in the neighborhoods around the Metropolitan Region of Belém. The survey was based on the following question: To what extent are citizens and civil society organizations willing to form partnerships to coproduce with the government?. The results of this article show that citizens and civil society organizations are willing to coproduce with governments and explore the conditions for these partnerships to happen.

Primary qualitative data are analyzed to produce a genealogical account of these policy developments, and Braman’s concept of “informational power” is used to frame a critical narrative of the broader dynamics of power at play. We argue that although there have been significant tensions around efforts to open the United Kingdom’s weather data, these have largely been absorbed by and, ultimately, contained within the hegemonic structures of the United Kingdom’s neoliberal state.

The paper outlines a Responsive Geographical Information Systems (“Responsive Mobile Coverage (RMC)") of a large number of point data of mobile networks integrating summarization techniques and dynamic visual models. Methodology For that purpose, an integrated framework of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and GIS Cloud Computing is described and implemented using open source tools such as Jupyter (Python), ArcGIS Online and the ESRI Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS. The methodology was tested with data of Barcelona in August 2015. Conclusions The RMC framework presents capabilities to integrate additional information from the Catalonian Big Data landscape, and therefore, improve the access to Open data for public sector, private companies, citizens and scientists. The developed methods have potential for the definition and analysis of the distribution of aggregation indicators in cities, monitoring the precision of mobile networks in different administrative and urban contexts, and enabling citizens to make sense of such data for improving their scientific knowledge, daily life and fostering collective decision making. Originality The paper demonstrates that RMC can be a very useful tool for responsive visualization and improving different decision-making processes in Barcelona. We suggest an approach to data science, where the complete workflow takes place inside a Big Data paradigm, to produce reproducible results, using the best practices in scientific research. © AÑO 14, núm. 40, JUNIO 2019.},

STD programs in health departments often provide both STD services and HIV-specific services, including partner services such as interviewing and testing sex partners. What is added by this report? Findings from this report show that STD programs often provide integral HIV specific services including HIV field testing for STD contacts and linking those found to be HIV-positive to care. This report also illustrates that state health departments often perform visits to HIV providers to provide STD information or public health updates as well as perform epidemiologic activities, including matching STD cases report data with HIV data to analyze interactions between the diseases or overlaps. What are the implications for public health practices? STD programs can play an essential role in reducing HIV transmission among patients with STD diagnoses. Front line interaction with STD patients and contacts at high risk for HIV provides opportunities for quicker HIV testing and linkage to care. STD programs might also gain important insights in STD and HIV epidemiology as well as possible interactions between the diseases by matching and analyzing STD case report and HIV data, to the extent such data sharing is possible. © 2017, Department of Health and Human Services.

	abstract = {This paper builds on the data designer (government) and local data-user concepts in terms of “technological duality.” This model applies Orlikowski’s structurational model of technology that extends basic ideas about interactions of organizations and information communication technology (ICT). The model is supported by its application to multiple interpretative case studies of the Philippine Open Government initiative. It was evidenced that open government data as a technology is subjective—understood and interpreted inconsistently by the government and data users and therefore creates a disconnect between them. Based on the cases presented, it is proposed that a two-way open governance model will be a more effective approach in developing a truly open government. This reinforces the role of user-side stakeholders as they have the interest, expertise, and resources to utilize open data and can therefore build networks with more users within their respective fields that government initiatives may not be able to reach. © 2019, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

Between 2014 and 2017, we conducted four case studies on government administrative data for education, transport, energy and health. The purpose of the research was to examine stakeholder perspectives about the sharing, linking and re-use (secondary use) of government administrative data. In relation to the role and nature of consent given by data subjects for re-use, our study revealed significant variations in data provider and researcher attitudes. Although our study setting was England, we believe that the findings have wider resonance. Our analysis identified six factors which might account for the variations around consent: the specificities of the legislative framework governing the collection and processing of particular data; the type of data being collected and the relational context in which it is created; the broader information governance framework in which the data resides; the creating organization's approach to data release; the relative levels of risk aversity within the creating organization; and public perceptions and social attitudes. In conclusion, we consider whether consent is still the best mechanism available for data re-use, or whether a social contract model of data sharing should be developed. © The Author(s) 2018.},

Our study proposes a mixed methodology applied to 45 French institutional infrastructures, to compare the objectives stated by their promoters, their content, and the actual services provided. The methodology, based on an analysis of interviews with Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) coordinators and their answers to questionnaires, as well as a study of their websites and an exploration of over 160,000 metadata in their metadata catalogues, produced varied results concerning data accessibility, stakeholder networks, the interoperability of tools, and informational equality in different regions. Despite the proactive stance of SDI promoters, only 15.7\% of data are open-access. Their interoperability remains restricted to specific types of actors and themes. Although geocollaboration organised by SDIs is very active, it only concerns the public sector. These disparities also concern their informational dimension, as some regions have considerable resources at their disposal, but others do not. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Open government data and access to public sector information is commonplace, yet little attention has focussed on the essential roles and responsibilities in practice of the information and records management professionals, who enable public authorities to deliver open data to citizens. This paper aims to consider the perspectives of open government and information practitioners in England on the procedural and policy implications of open data across local public authorities. Design/methodology/approach: Using four case studies from different parts of the public sector in England (local government, higher education, National Health Service and hospital trust), the research involved master’s level students in the data collection and analysis, alongside academics, thus enhancing the learning experience of students. Findings: There was little consistency in the location of responsibility for open government data policy, the range of job roles involved or the organisational structures, policy and guidance in place to deliver this function. While this may reflect the organisational differences and professional concerns, it makes it difficult to share best practice. Central government policy encourages public bodies to make their data available for re-use. However, local practice is very variable and perhaps understandably responds more to local organisational strategic and resource priorities. The research found a lack of common metadata standards for open data, different choices about which data to open, problems of data redundancy, inconsistency and data integrity and a wide variety of views on the corporate and public benefits of open data. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to England and to non-national public bodies and only draws data from a small number of case studies. Originality/value: The research contributes to the debate about emerging issues around the complexities of open government data and its public benefits, contributing to the discussions around technology-enabled approaches to citizen engagement and governance. It offers new insights into the interaction between open data and public policy objectives, drawing on the experience of local public sectors in England. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Italy is an interesting case for four different reasons: (1) to date, few analyses have been carried out on Mediterranean countries; (2) the Italian media system and its traditional journalism culture appear to be reluctant to innovate; (3) Italian data journalists are generally freelancers linked to small news agencies rather than established newsrooms; (4) the research reported in this paper was accomplished while the Italian government was approving a Freedom of Information Act. From the end of 2015 to the beginning of 2017, we carried out 15 interviews with data journalists working full-time for both established news organizations and specialized agencies. The findings show that data journalism in Italy is a highly professional sub-field, although journalistic education is not well developed. Data journalism is still largely determined by the availability and accessibility of public datasets. However, data journalists have developed certain strategies with which to generate and collect their own data, for instance collaborations and networks. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

It is composed of a number of dimensions that can be measured to understand issues possibly arising in the implementation of a policy or of a project targeting a community. Measuring these dimensions is thus highly valuable for policymakers and local administrator, though expensive and time consuming. To address this issue, we evaluated their estimation through a machine learning technique—Random Forests—applied to secondary open government data and determined the most important variables for prediction. We focused on two dimensions: sense of community and participation. The variables included in the data sets used to train the predictive models complied with two criteria: nationwide availability and sufficiently fine-grained geographic breakdown, that is, neighborhood level. Our resultant models are more accurate than others based on traditional statistics found in the literature, showing the feasibility of the approach. The most determinant variables in our models were only partially in agreement with the most influential factors for sense of community and participation according to the social science literature consulted, providing a starting point for future investigation under a social science perspective. Moreover, due to the lack of geographic detail of the outcome measures available, further research is required to apply the predictive models to a neighborhood level. © 2017 Policy Studies Organization},

The UK Data Service and its predecessors developed data management, documentation, and publishing procedures and protocols that stand today as robust templates for data publishing. As the ESRC research data policy requires grant holders to submit their research data to the UK Data Service after a grant ends, setting standards and promoting them has been essential in raising the quality of the resulting research data being published. In the past, received data were all processed, documented, and published for reuse in-house. Recent investments have focused on guiding and training researchers in good data management practices and skills for creating shareable data, as well as a self-publishing repository system, ReShare. ReShare also receives data sets described in published data papers and achieves scientific quality assurance through peer review of submitted data sets before publication. Social science data are reused for research, to inform policy, in teaching and for methods learning. Over a 10 years period, responsive developments in system workflows, access control options, persistent identifiers, templates, and checks, together with targeted guidance for researchers, have helped raise the standard of self-publishing social science data. Lessons learned and developments in shifting publishing social science data from an archivist responsibility to a researcher process are showcased, as inspiration for institutions setting up a data repository. © 2016, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction: The article addresses a theme still scarcely debated within studies on bureaucracy and public policy: documents as material artifacts and their effects on bureaucrats, public policies, and politics within the State. It aims to promote a debate on the importance of documents as instruments of public action, as well as to propose a new classification for a subtype of middle-level bureaucrats, labeled back-office bureaucrats. Materials and Methods: The research stems from an ethnography on documentation practices that was undertaken during three years in which both authors took park on a wide-scope administrative reform on documentation practices at São Paulo's City Hall. As means of information gathering, it involved participant observation, multiple interviews and a selection of legislation and administrative case files. Results: From this research, we have found that the interaction between the time of politics - which relates to the interactions between incumbent, government officials, bureaucracies and civil society - and the time of paperwork - which is related to the set of rules that establishes modes of record-keeping for bureaucratic activities, degrees of mandatoriness for such activities, and disciplinary control - on back-office bureaucrats is decisive to understanding their behavior, which is aimed at mitigating professional risks. Secondly, we have observed that the set of practices promoted by these bureaucrats reflects a mobilization of a particular set of properties that documents carry within the broader context of bureaucracy: the production of truth, the transposition of old solutions into new contexts and the (lack of) evidence of a political deal. Discussion: As a result of these findings, we point to three implications. The first one, the dynamics of bureaucratic action can help explains the tendency for inertia within bureaucracies and public policies, highlighting the need for extensive negotiations and the set of new landmarks of documentation so that innovative projects can succeed within bureaucracies. The second one, the promotion of documentation practices may produce further opacity, as opposed to what open data policies might expect. Finally, this approach points to new issues for the debates of bureaucratic capacities and coordination. When the State is regarded not just from the individual action of its agents and the intertwining of personal networks, but also from the ways the materiality of instruments of action within them can influence said relations, the challenges of political leadership, as well as the task of understanding it, become more complex. © 2019 Universidade Federal do Parana.},

Our findings show that these tools have a small number of users but that their main target are not citizens but specific groups, mainly media and political groups. Its adoption is neither a budgetary nor technological problem, although the free software license gives clear advantages. The impulse for adoption is mainly political with the main focus on financial and budgetary transparency but sometimes also on participatory transparency or microtransparency. Finally, we detect a serious risk of governance generated by the lack of clear transparency and accountability strategies in the administrations, as well as an absence of operational procedures to adapt to the changing budgetary structure. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Freely used and accessible data produced by government bodies presumably encourages citizen participation and makes government more transparent and accountable. However, there is limited evidence that citizens would take advantage of open data and on what drives that usagee. This study expands the technology acceptance model to take into account citizens’ perception of open data's potential societal risks as well as potential advantages to society and the advantages of delivering positive social outcomes. The analysis of results from of an online survey conducted in Taiwan in May 2017 confirms that a majority of respondents agree that open crime data has advantages compared with aggregate-level statistical data, while risks involved in the adoption of open crime data is are indeed a concern for a majority of respondents. Both help to explain citizens’ intentions of using to use open crime data. Citizens’ perception of usefulness is positively related to their intention to use open data. However, perceived ease of use of open crime data is not significantly associated with the intention to use open crime data directly. Future research should consider other ways to reach citizens who do not use the internet regularly. A better understanding of citizens’ responses to open data helps government design continued improvements to open data. © 2019 Center for Public Administration Research, Sun Yat-sen University.},

	abstract = {As an increasing number of open government data (OGD) portals are created, an evaluation method is needed to assess these portals. In this study, we drew from the existing principles and evaluation methods to develop a User Interaction Framework, with concrete criteria in five dimensions: Access, Trust, Understand, Engage-integrate, and Participate. The framework was then used to evaluate the current OGD sites created and maintained by 34 U.S. municipal government agencies. The results show that, overall, portals perform well in terms of providing access, but not so well in helping users understand and engage with data. These findings indicate room for improvement in multiple areas and suggest potential roles for information professionals as data mediators. The study also reveals that portals using the Socrata platform performed better, regarding user access, trust, engagement, and participation. However, the variability among portals indicates that some portals should improve their platforms to achieve greater user engagement and participation. In addition, city governments need to develop clear plans about what data should be available and how to make them available to their public. © 2018 ASIS\&T},

The article aims to explore the relationship between technological progress, cross-border e-commerce and the establishment of global digital customs from the dimensions of the latest development of new digital infrastructure, national Single Window system and global vision of creating Electronic World Trade Platform (eWTP). It is argued that cross-border e-commerce platforms, national Single Window and eWTP, all of which are indispensable for the establishment of global digital customs, have close linkages in business regulation, data sharing and information exchange.

As an emergent phenomenon, however, there is a gap in the literature with regards to Open Science and its impact on governmental research and development organizations. From this perspective, this paper aims to report the participative construction of a national commitment under the theme ‘Innovation and Open Government in Science’, proposed and committed to by Brazil in its 4th National Action Plan on Open Government. The methodology applied for the construction of this commitment was developed and executed by the Executive Group of the Inter-ministerial Committee responsible for the Open Government Partnership activities in the Country. The 4th National Action Plan of the Open Government Partnership was published in October 2018 and actions associated with it are in progress. Preliminary results show the instrumentality of the Open Government Partnership for the construction of a collaborative strategy in support of Open Science in Brazil, in which the main actors of the national scientific system participate. © 2019 Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Campinas.

The purpose of this paper is to empirically test a model of cooperative relations affecting local governments and thus having impact on local autonomy and dependence. Design/methodology/approach: This paper takes previous typologies as a starting point to theoretically build and empirically test a model of cooperative relations based on two selected indicators: the degree of autonomy-dependence and the degree of rigidity-flexibility of the cooperative system. In a second step, the authors stimulate the model numerically to match real data on it coming from South European local governments to assess the functioning of the theory in a concrete space and time. Findings: The combination of the aforementioned concepts, creates a four-option theoretical model that describes four possible situations where cooperative intergovernmental relations can be empirically placed. Originality/value: This paper points out the need to incorporate empirical studies to trace the characteristics and evolution of the cooperative relations between local governments and upper tiers. This is particularly relevant if the authors are referring to mechanisms that can vary through time. In the current big and open data era, this empirical process will become easier and more affordable. In this context, local government studies benefit from particular features that improve the operation of this kind of analysis: large “N” configuration (a large number of units to be included) and a reasonable equivalence in concepts and bodies that allows comparability. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: The authors applied four data collection techniques: a literature review, semi-structured interviews (n=15), online resources analysis (n=26) and an online survey (n=113). They used constant comparative analysis to identify perceived benefits and challenges of LD implementation, reasons behind adoption or non-adoption of LD and the issues hindering its implementation in libraries. Findings: Some projects demonstrate LD’s potential to augment the visibility and discoverability of library data, alongside with overcoming linguistic barriers, and supporting interoperability. However, a strong need remains to demonstrate the Semantic Web’s potential within libraries. Participants identified lack of expertise and lack of resources/time/staff as implementation barriers. Several other issues remain unsolved, such as licensing constraints, as well as difficulties with obtaining management buy-in for LD initiatives, even where open data are government-mandated. Practical implications: Information professionals and vendors should collaborate to develop tools for implementation. Advocacy through disseminating and reviewing successful implementations can help to solve practical difficulties and to obtain management buy-in. Originality/value: This is the first known study to present a multinational, comprehensive picture of library LD implementations and associated librarians’ perceptions of LD. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This research focuses on the cases of three US states-Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. We examine the stated goals of each portal and any policies related to their establishment or upkeep. We then examine the portals with regard to updating, reuse, organization and other factors. Of the three cases, Vermont’s portal is moderately successful and continues to be used. New Hampshire’s strategy of linking to data on agency websites is inconsistent, but the state law requiring data published to be in open formats does mean data is more open when it is provided. Maine’s portal went dormant soon after its initial creation, and was fully taken down in the timeframe of this research. These cases illustrate that the establishment of a state portal alone does not guarantee that the portal will support the desired outcomes. © 2019, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

However, it is of little or no use to know all about it if we do not know what to do with it or have the capacity to exploit it. In this context, and faced with the scarce initiatives in the educational field, this study is presented with the objective of studying open data within the scope of the Spanish Faculties of Education, aiming to learn whether they can be used in higher education as a teaching resource. The main objective is to know what type of perception university professors have regarding the use and value of open data for the teaching-learning process. The sample was of 192 teachers, with a maximum margin of error applicable to non-segmented global data with a confidence level of 95.5\%, which in the worst case (p = q = 50\%) is ±7.2\%. A non-experimental research design has been developed, of an exploratory type, using the instrument of thequestionnaire for the collection of information.

These promises hinge on “data intermediaries”: extra-institutional actors that obtain, use, and translate data for the public. However, we know little about why these individuals might regard open data as a site of civic participation. In response, we draw on Ilana Gershon to conceptualize culturally situated and socially constructed perspectives on data, or “data ideologies.” This study employs mixed methodologies to examine why members of the public hold particular data ideologies and how they vary. In late 2015 the authors engaged the public through a commission in a diverse city of approximately 500,000. Qualitative data was collected from three public focus groups with residents. Simultaneously, we obtained quantitative data from surveys. Participants’ data ideologies varied based on how they perceived data to be useful for collaboration, tasks, and translations. Bucking the “geek” stereotype, only a minority of those surveyed (20\%) were professional software developers or engineers. Although only a nascent movement, we argue open data intermediaries have important roles to play in a new political landscape. © The Author(s) 2017.},

It reveals more of continuity than a break with the urban socio-technical regime generated by these projects. Technologies are not evenly developed along different domains: the fact that the most sophisticated innovations play out in the regulation of networks rather than in e-government reinforces an old two-speed urban modernisation. The mainly technological character of these projects is part of the continuity of a depoliticised strategy for managing technical matters.

	abstract = {Over the past few years, Public Administrations have been providing systems for procedures and files electronic processing to ensure compliance with regulations and provide public services to citizens. Although each administration provides similar services to their citizens, these systems usually differ from the internal information management point of view since they usually come from different products and manufacturers. The common framework that regulations demand, and that Public Administrations must respect when processing electronic files, provides a unique opportunity for the development of intelligent agents in the field of administrative processes. However, for this development to be truly effective and applicable to the public sector, it is necessary to have a common representation model for these administrative processes. Although a lot of work has already been done in the development of public information reuse initiatives and common vocabularies standardization, this has not been carried out at the processes level. In this paper, we propose a semantic representation model of both processes models and processes for Public Administrations: the procedures and administrative files. The goal is to improve public administration open data initiatives and help to develop their sustainability policies, such as improving decision-making procedures and administrative management sustainability. As a case study, we modelled public administrative processes and files in collaboration with a Regional Public Administration in Spain, the Principality of Asturias, which enabled access to its information systems, helping the evaluation of our approach. © 2018 by the authors.},

At the same time, there are fears of a widening digital divide, where large groups of society are in danger of being excluded from societal processes, for example due to having difficulties in using the online tools provided. In this paper, we propose an approach that has the potential to address many key issues in this context (e.g. accessibility, complexity, engagement). It relies on space and time as common integrators, and uses augmented interactive geo-visualizations to facilitate citizen engagement. We report on key challenges that need to be overcome to realize this approach and on initial progress towards this goal. We describe a set of prototypical tools aimed at supporting citizen engagement in the envisioned way, and discuss the approach as well as its potentials, issues and challenges in detail. Initial experiences and results indicate that our approach is not only technically feasible but it can also empower citizens to more effectively engage with societal and governmental processes. © 2014, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

	abstract = {Purpose: In the open science era, it is typical to share project-generated scientific data by depositing it in an open and accessible database. Moreover, scientific publications are preserved in a digital library archive. It is challenging to identify the data usage that is mentioned in literature and associate it with its source. Here, we investigated the data usage of a government-funded cancer genomics project, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), via a full-text literature analysis. Design/methodology/approach: We focused on identifying articles using the TCGA dataset and constructing linkages between the articles and the specific TCGA dataset. First, we collected 5,372 TCGA-related articles from PubMed Central (PMC). Second, we constructed a benchmark set with 25 full-text articles that truly used the TCGA data in their studies, and we summarized the key features of the benchmark set. Third, the key features were applied to the remaining PMC full-text articles that were collected from PMC. Findings: The amount of publications that use TCGA data has increased significantly since 2011, although the TCGA project was launched in 2005. Additionally, we found that the critical areas of focus in the studies that use the TCGA data were glioblastoma multiforme, lung cancer, and breast cancer; meanwhile, data from the RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) platform is the most preferable for use. Research limitations: The current workflow to identify articles that truly used TCGA data is labor-intensive. An automatic method is expected to improve the performance. Practical implications: This study will help cancer genomics researchers determine the latest advancements in cancer molecular therapy, and it will promote data sharing and data-intensive scientific discovery. Originality/value: Few studies have been conducted to investigate data usage by government-funded projects/programs since their launch. In this preliminary study, we extracted articles that use TCGA data from PMC, and we created a link between the full-text articles and the source data. © Journal of Data and Information Science.

	abstract = {The diffusion of Open Government Data (OGD) in recent years kept a very fast pace. However, evidence from practitioners shows that disclosing data without proper quality control may jeopardize dataset reuse and negatively affect civic participation. Current approaches to the problem in literature lack a comprehensive theoretical framework. Moreover, most of the evaluations concentrate on open data platforms, rather than on datasets.In this work, we address these two limitations and set up a framework of indicators to measure the quality of Open Government Data on a series of data quality dimensions at most granular level of measurement. We validated the evaluation framework by applying it to compare two cases of Italian OGD datasets: an internationally recognized good example of OGD, with centralized disclosure and extensive data quality controls, and samples of OGD from decentralized data disclosure (municipality level), with no possibility of extensive quality controls as in the former case, hence with supposed lower quality.Starting from measurements based on the quality framework, we were able to verify the difference in quality: the measures showed a few common acquired good practices and weaknesses, and a set of discriminating factors that pertain to the type of datasets and the overall approach. On the basis of this evaluation, we also provided technical and policy guidelines to overcome the weaknesses observed in the decentralized release policy, addressing specific quality aspects. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

So far, most studies have focused on conceptual models, specific aspects of transparency in particular case studies or have compared legal frameworks from different countries. Here, data about citizens' requests to get access to administrative documents have been gathered. Th is dataset, combined with existing indexes on open data and government, has enabled us to establish a national ranking, particularly useful in a comparative perspective. Data about trust have been collected from reports published by international organisations. Key findings prove that there is no sharp decline of trust in government in all countries considered in this article. Th ey also tend to show that transparency and trust in government are not systematically positively associated. Therefore, this article challenges the common assumption, mostly found in the normative literature, about a positive interrelation between the two, where trust in government is conceived as a beneficial effect of administrative transparency. Finally, it suggests that mis(trust) maybe considered a key driver of transparency and would as such call for more transparency from public bodies.},

Yet, several constraints and legal uncertainties subsist beyond the façade of Open Data.

While politicians support data release and assume that the positive value of open data will dominate, many governmental organizations are reluctant to open their data, as they are afraid of the dark side. The objective of this paper is to provide a decision-making model that assists in trade-offs between the pros and cons of open data. Data disclosure is dependent on the type of data (e.g. its sensitivity, structure and quality) and the context (e.g. organizational policies, legislation and the political influences). Based on the literature and fifteen in-depth interviews with public sector officials and data archivists, this paper identifies contextual and dataset-related variables which influence a trade-off. A decision-making model is presented capturing trade-offs, and in this way providing guidance for weighing the creation of public value and the risks. The model can be used for decision-making to open or not to open data. It is likely that the decision regarding which data should be opened or closed will shift over time. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.},

Our key conclusions are that 1) the criticality of the factors depends considerably on the context of the open data initiative; 2) a number of success factors appear to be more universally applicable than others; 3) the factors that are critical to all three cases are derived from many different success factor categories, which suggests that open data initiatives should adopt an interdisciplinary approach, and 4) further work is needed to detail the success factors for open data publication and use in other contexts. © 2015, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

The ability to use open data partly depends on the availability of open data technologies. However, the actual use of open data technologies has shown mixed results, and there is a paucity of research on the predictors affecting the acceptance and use of open data technologies. A better understanding of these predictors can help policy-makers to determine which policy instruments they can use to increase the acceptance and use of open data technologies. A modified model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) is used to empirically determine predictors influencing the acceptance and use of open data technologies. The results show that the predictors performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions and voluntariness of use together account for 45\% of the variability in people's behavioral intention to use open data technologies. Except for facilitating conditions, all these predictors significantly influence behavioral intention. Our analysis of the predictors that influence the acceptance and use of open data technologies can be used to stimulate the use of open data technologies. The findings suggest that policy-makers should increase the acceptance and use of open data technologies by showing the benefits of open data use, by creating awareness of users that they already use open data, by developing social strategies to encourage people to stimulate each other to use open data, by integrating open data use in daily activities, and by decreasing the effort necessary to use open data technologies. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

The practice of disseminating selected sub-sets of data (usually in summary tables) permits only very limited types of aruse, and thus hampers scholarship.

However, seeing data management primarily as a matter of compliance means that the arsearch community faces continued data loss, as many datasets enter arpositories without adequate description to enable their aruse.

The author participated in a study group on digital archives hosted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of the Japanese Government from February 2011 to March 2012. The group discussed the promotion of digital archives in Japan, particularly at memory institutions. The Great East Japan Earthquake of 11 March 2011 caused serious damage in the north-eastern part of Japan, especially the Pacific coastal regions. This disaster significantly affected the discussions of the group. The basic lesson that the author learned is that digital archives built on a robust information environment are essential for keeping our community memory safe for the future. Not only do the primary digital resources need to be properly maintained and preserved for the future but also secondary resources, metadata and meta-metadata. We need to use Linked Open Data technologies to enhance the usability of such digital resources in the archives. © 2014 Australian Society of Archivists.},

This study is based on 22 in-depth interviews with U.K. researchers in systems biology, synthetic biology, and bioinformatics, which were conducted between September 2013 and February 2014. Through an analysis of the interview transcripts, we identify seven core themes that characterize researchers’ understanding of openness in science and nine factors that shape the practice of openness in research. Our findings highlight the implications that Open Science policies can have for research processes and outcomes and provide recommendations for enhancing their content, effectiveness, and implementation. © The Author(s) 2016.},

	abstract = {One essential characteristic of open data ecosystems is their development through feedback loops, discussions and dynamic data users-suppliers interactions. These user-centric features communicate the users’ needs to the open data community as well to the public sector organizations responsible for data publication. Addressing these needs by the corresponding public sector organizations, or even by utilising the power of the community, can significantly promote and accelerate innovation. However, such elements appear barely to be part of existing open data practices in the public sector. In this paper we describe and discuss an open data platform, which contributes to filling this gap, by providing Web 2.0 functionality that supports and intensifies open data users-suppliers interactions, and then we present a usage scenario of it, explaining the sequence of using its functionality. The discussed open data infrastructure combines functionalities that aim to close the feedback loop and to return information to public authorities that can be useful for better government data opening and publication, as well as for establishing communication channels between all stakeholders that fosters their collaboration. This may effectively lead to the stimulation and facilitation of value generation from open data, as such functionality positions the user at the centre of the open data publication process. © 2014, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

	abstract = {This article shows how activists in the open data movement re-articulate notions of democracy, participation, and journalism by applying practices and values from open source culture to the creation and use of data. Focusing on the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany and drawing from a combination of interviews and content analysis, it argues that this process leads activists to develop new rationalities around datafication that can support the agency of datafied publics. Three modulations of open source are identified: First, by regarding data as a prerequisite for generating knowledge, activists transform the sharing of source code to include the sharing of raw data. Sharing raw data should break the interpretative monopoly of governments and would allow people to make their own interpretation of data about public issues. Second, activists connect this idea to an open and flexible form of representative democracy by applying the open source model of participation to political participation. Third, activists acknowledge that intermediaries are necessary to make raw data accessible to the public. This leads them to an interest in transforming journalism to become an intermediary in this sense. At the same time, they try to act as intermediaries themselves and develop civic technologies to put their ideas into practice. The article concludes with suggesting that the practices and ideas of open data activists are relevant because they illustrate the connection between datafication and open source culture and help to understand how datafication might support the agency of publics and actors outside big government and big business. © The Author(s) 2015.},

	abstract = {In June 1215 King John put his seal to Magna Carta, which over the centuries has become an icon of English (British) liberties. Clause 40 about not selling, denying or delaying justice, and Clause 39, that no free man is to be imprisoned or dispossessed “save by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land” are still in force today. For these reasons Lord Denning described Magna Carta as “the greatest constitutional document of all times—the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot”. In other words the executive can never be above the law, but for this principle to be enforced the state must disclose evidence by due process to the public by which it can be held to account. This essay explores the threats to openness of government in the digital age, which runs the risk of undermining this fundamental principle of the British constitution. These range from the intrusiveness of our surveillance society, ill-considered notions of a post-privacy world, misconceived concepts of open data to the immense difficulty of scrutinizing born-digital data released under due process for sensitive content. Such threats are balanced by a much more assertive judiciary under the supreme court, which like its American counterpart strikes down legislation, an unelected second chamber willing to challenge the executive and House of Commons select committees that are increasingly baring their teeth.

Opening up data aims for citizens, scientists and organizations to easily access, discover and exploit the data, and consequently to benefit from them. As a result, there is an emerging need to integrate and represent data in transparent and reusable ways, with a high degree of interoperability which will further facilitate the discovery of new connections and insights by linking data coming from diverse sources. Statistical data published either by government bodies or by national statistical authorities are used for policy and decision making purposes, as they present important socioeconomic indicators.

Open government has long been considered vital to democratic society but, with the arrival of digital government, openness has become touted by governments that use information and communication technologies (ICT) without making the necessary legal and institutional reforms to support accountability and transparency. The intersection of openness and ICT challenges our approach to digital government in public administration practice and theory, and it calls for better theoretical frameworks to make sense of open government performance. In this paper, I propose a threefold framework of efficiency, democratic responsiveness, and legal-rational process. The framework is conceptually analyzed through four types of open government: budget transparency, citizen engagement, open data, and freedom of information. The analysis results in the creation of a set of measurement items that help to clarify important aspects of open government performance, and which can be used to generate indicators for evaluating open government initiatives. © 2016 Center for Public Administration Research, Sun Yat-sen University.},

Concerning the data, we analyse linked open data on municipal solid waste expenditure collected by the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic and data relating to features of waste collection obtained via a questionnaire-based survey which was carried out at the turn of 2015 - 2016. The results of the presented analysis show a clear relationship of dependence between the inter-municipal cooperation and the relevant costs, and it confirms the assumption that the Czech local governments undoubtedly prefer the position of "providers" in the field of the local waste management. Paradoxically, the results show that neither internal nor external provision of waste-collection services is a key factor of cost-efficiency.},

	abstract = {This article investigates the claims and complexities involved in the platform-based economics of health and fitness apps. We examine a double-edged logic inscribed in these platforms, promising to offer personal solutions to medical problems while also contributing to the public good. On the one hand, online platforms serve as personalized data-driven services to their customers. On the other hand, they allegedly serve public interests, such as medical research or health education. In doing so, many apps employ a diffuse discourse, hinging on terms like “sharing,” “open,” and “reuse” when they talk about data extraction and distribution. The analytical approach we adopt in this article is situated at the nexus of science and technology studies, political economy, and the sociology of health and illness. The analysis concentrates on two aspects: datafication (the use and reuse of data) and commodification (a platform’s deployment of governance and business models). We apply these analytical categories to three specific platforms: 23andMe, PatientsLikeMe, and Parkinson mPower. The last section will connect these individual examples to the wider implications of health apps’ data flows, governance policies, and business models. Regulatory bodies commonly focus on the (medical) safety and security of apps, but pay scarce attention to health apps’ techno-economic governance. Who owns user-generated health data and who gets to benefit? We argue that it is important to reflect on the societal implications of health data markets. Governments have the duty to provide conceptual clarity in the grand narrative of transforming health care and health research. © The Author(s) 2016.},

The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of essential elements of open data ecosystems for enabling easy publication and use of open data. To achieve this objective, the literature has been reviewed and a scenario about the publication and use of open data has been analyzed. It was found that various applications, tools and portals are available which together can form an ecosystem. The best functionalities of this ecosystem can be selected and utilized by open data providers and users. To create an open data ecosystem at least four key elements should be captured, namely, 1) releasing and publishing open data on the internet, 2) searching, finding, evaluating and viewing data and their related licenses, 3) cleansing, analyzing, enriching, combining, linking and visualizing data and 4) interpreting and discussing data and providing feedback to the data provider and other stakeholders. Furthermore, to integrate the ecosystem elements and to let them act as an integrated whole, there should be three additional elements 5) user pathways showing directions for how open data can be used, 6) a quality management system and 7) different types of metadata to be able to connect the elements. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.

	abstract = {Purpose - The aim of this paper is to describe a local government effort to realise an open government agenda. This is done using a storytelling approach. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical data are based on a case study. The authors participated in, as well as followed, the process of realising an open government agenda on a local level, where citizens were invited to use open public data as the basis for developing apps and external Web solutions. Based on an interpretative tradition, they chose storytelling as a way to scrutinise the competition process. In this paper, they present a story about the competition process using the story elements put forward by Kendall and Kendall (2012). Findings - The research builds on existing research by proposing the myth that the “public” wants to make use of open data. The authors provide empirical insights into the challenge of gaining benefits from open public data. In particular, they illustrate the difficulties in getting citizens interested in using open public data. Their case shows that people seem to like the idea of open public data, but do not necessarily participate actively in the data reuse process. Research limitations/implications - The results are based on one empirical study. Further research is, therefore, needed. The authors would especially welcome more studies that focus on citizens’ interest and willingness to reuse open public data. Practical implications - This study illustrates the difficulties of promoting the reuse of open public data. Public organisations that want to pursue an open government agenda can use these findings as empirical insights. Originality/value - This paper answers the call for more empirical studies on public open data. Furthermore, it problematises the “myth” of public interest in the reuse of open public data. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Creating commercial value through open data use in open data ecosystems is a wicked problem. This problem is characterized by a lack of specific formulation, complex interactions amongst a variety of stakeholders, a lack of criteria determining a satisfactory solution, including what constitutes 'value', and uncertain outcomes. Wicked problems cannot be solved by only considering part of the problem. Yet, open data efforts all too often focus mainly on open data publication and neglect the use of the data; while it is the use of data (not just publication) that generates value. This paper addresses the question: Which policy guidelines can support commercial value creation from open data? This study first elicits characteristics of wicked problems for studying the wicked problem of commercial open data value creation. Subsequently, we use the wicked problem characteristics to study open data innovation in two countries and consult experts. This work results in eliciting four policy guidelines that can help to derive greater commercial value from open data ecosystems. The four policy guidelines show that governmental open data policies for commercial value should pay attention to: 1) increasing the knowledge of open data ecosystem stakeholders about contextual factors influencing open data use and commercial value creation, 2) ensuring the availability and quality of five types of resources: open data, open Information Technology (IT), internal IT, knowledge and governance, 3) cooperating between businesses and citizens to create alliances, and 4) reducing the negative effects of value creation by companies in the open data ecosystem. These policy guidelines are expected to stimulate commercial value creation with open data use. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.},

The purpose of this paper is to clarify the concept of transparency-by-design to advance open government. Design/methodology/approach: The opening of data, the deployment of tools and instruments to engage the public, collaboration among public organizations and between governments and the public are important drivers for open government. The authors review transparency-by-design concepts. Findings: To successfully achieve open government, fundamental changes in practice and new research on governments as open systems are needed. In particular, the creation of “transparency-by-design” is a key aspect in which transparency is a key system development requirement, and the systems ensure that data are disclosed to the public for creating transparency. Research limitations/implications: Although transparency-by-design is an intuitive concept, more research is needed in what constitutes information and communication technology-mediated transparency and how it can be realized. Practical implications: Governments should embrace transparency-by-design to open more data sets and come closer to achieving open government.

	abstract = {Human health is greatly affected by inadequate access to sufficient and safe drinking water, especially in low and middle-income countries. Drinking water governance improvements may be one way to better drinking water quality. Over the past decade, many projects and international organizations have been dedicated to water governance; however, water governance in the drinking water sector is understudied and how to improve water governance remains unclear. We analyze drinking water governance challenges in three countries - Brazil, Ecuador, and Malawi - as perceived by government, service providers, and civil society organizations. A mixed methods approach was used: a clustering model was used for country selection and qualitative semi-structured interviews were used with direct observation in data collection. The clustering model integrated political, economic, social and environmental variables that impact water sector performance, to group countries. Brazil, Ecuador and Malawi were selected with the model so as to represent the diversity of the clusters. This comparative case study is important because similar challenges are identified in the drinking water sectors of each country; while, the countries represent diverse socio-economic and political contexts, and the case selection process provides generalizability to our results. We find that access to safe water could be improved if certain water governance challenges were addressed: coordination and data sharing between ministries that deal with drinking water services; monitoring and enforcement of water quality laws; and sufficient technical capacity to improve administrative and technical management of water services at the local level. From an analysis of our field research, we also developed a conceptual framework that identifies policy levers that could be used to influence governance of drinking water quality on national and sub-national levels, and the relationships between these levers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

This article offers a theoretical approach, as well as empirical evidence, regarding recent moves in contemporary public management derived from the adoption, use, and diffusion of social media technologies in public organizations. This article supports the idea of an emerging paradigm in public management denoted as ‘smart governance’, which is compared with previous paradigms on the basis of renewed principles including values derived from philosophy 2.0, open data and transparency, social media platforms, a focus on citizen participation and external knowledge in the decision-making process, and new collaboration dynamics among public employees and organizations (Criado, 2016; Noveck, 2015). This paradigm shift is empirically investigated through four case studies, two social media platforms for citizen crowdsourcing (Challenge.gov y SantanderCityBrain) and two social media platforms for open collaboration among public employees (GitHub y NovaGob). The conclusions of the study shed light on the most recent transformations in the technological dimension of public administration, and discusses to what extent they will impact on our way of understanding the future of the public sector. © 2016, Centro Estudios Politicos Constitucionales.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how social media use reconfigures the organizing practices around such collaboration. A case study of a collaborative e-government project showcases how emergent organizing practices through external social media differ from existing ones along the dimensions of time, task, team and transition. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a case study of a collaborative e-government project on open data, organized by Shanghai Municipality, local businesses, universities and non-governmental organizations, using an external social media platform, WeChat. Adopting the theoretical lens of temporary organization, the paper identifies the key aspects of change emerged in the organizing practices of this collaboration. Findings: The findings outline how the use of external social media reconfigures the collaboration between government and non-government stakeholders along the four dimensions of time, task, team and transition. The new form of collaboration is reconfigured along the lines of (1) an ad hoc and non-linear management of time; (2) discursive task creation, assignment and engagement among stakeholders; (3) a serendipitous engagement of team members based on expertise; and (4) a shift in formal and informal organizing practices. Originality/value: This paper provides insights on the use of external social media for collaboration in e-government research and develops the concept of temporary organization in a sociomaterial setting. It also provides practical suggestions on how to manage new forms of public projects leveraging on the capacity of external social media. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

These initiatives have been taking place as part of the implementation of the Transparency Act, which sets forth deadlines and punishments concerning the adoption and performance of steps that focus on government transparency, such as the presence of transparency portals. Accordingly, this paper aims to check whether municipalities that keep portals with higher a Digital Transparency Index (DTI) will also prove to have the strongest open data initiatives. In order to achieve this goal we assess the official portals and open data initiatives in five Brazilian capitals by using the methodologies proposed by Paula Amorim (2012), and the prerequisites pointed out by the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF, 2011), and Tim Berners-Lee (2010). The results indicate that there is no direct relationship between the Digital Transparency Index and the strength of open data actions in each municipality. The discussion of the results points to the absence of a concise public policy on digital democracy that is able to promote transparency and government data simultaneously. © 2016, University of Zagreb.

This study shows that these types exhibit distinct behavior in four key indicators: (1) Rhythm, (2) Coverage, (3) Categorization, and (4) Feedback. This theoretical framework is examined using longitudinal mixed-method analysis of the OGD behavior of 16 US cities over a period of four years, using a corpus of municipal quantitative metadata and primary qualitative data.

However, currently data release by governments is still novel and there is little experience and knowledge thus far about its benefits, costs and barriers. This is compounded by a lack of understanding about how internal processes influence data release. Our aim in this paper is to get a better understanding of these processes and how they influence data release, i.e., to find determinants for the release of public sector information. For this purpose, we conducted workshops, interviews, questionnaires, desk research and practice based cases in the education program of our university, involving six local public sector organizations. We find that the way data is stored, the way data is obtained and the way data is used by a department are crucial indicators for open data release. We conclude with the lessons learned based on our research findings. These findings are: we should take a nuanced approach towards data release, avoid releasing data for its own sake, and take small incremental steps to explore data release. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to derive design principles for improving the open data publishing process of public organizations. Although governments create large amounts of data, the publication of open data is often cumbersome and there are no standard procedures and processes for opening data, blocking the easy publication of government data. Design/methodology/approach: Action design research (ADR) was used to derive design principles. The literature was used as a foundation, and discussion sessions with civil servants were used to evaluate the usefulness of the principles. Findings: Barriers preventing easy and low-cost publication of open data were identified and connected to design principles, which can be used to guide the design of an open data publishing process. Five new principles are: start thinking about the opening of data at the beginning of the process; develop guidelines, especially about privacy and policy sensitivity of data; provide decision support by integrating insight in the activities of other actors involved in the publishing process; make data publication an integral, well-defined and standardized part of daily procedures and routines; and monitor how the published data are reused. Research limitations/implications: The principles are derived using ADR in a single case. A next step can be to investigate multiple comparative case studies and detail the principles further. We recommend using these principles to develop a reference architecture. Practical implications: The design principles can be used by public organizations to improve their open data publishing processes. The design principles are derived from practice and discussed with practitioners. The discussions showed that the principles could improve the publication process. Social implications: Decreasing the barriers for publishing open government data could result in the publication of more open data. These open data can then be used to stimulate various public values, such as transparency, accountability, innovation, economic growth and informed decision- and policymaking. Originality/value: Publishing data by public organizations is a complex and ill-understood activity. The lack of suitable business processes and the unclear division of responsibilities block publication of open data. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting design principles which can be used to improve the open data publishing process of public sector organizations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Open data have the potential to improve the governance of universities as public institutions. In addition, open data are likely to increase the quality, efficacy and efficiency of the research and analysis of higher education systems by providing a shared empirical base for critical interrogation and reinterpretation. Drawing on research conducted by the Emerging Impacts of Open Data in Developing Countries project, and using an ecosystems approach, this research paper considers the supply, demand and use of open data as well as the roles of intermediaries in the governance of South African public higher education. It shows that government's higher education database is a closed and isolated data source in the data ecosystem; and that the open data that are made available by government is inaccessible and rarely used. In contrast, government data made available by data intermediaries in the ecosystem are being used by key stakeholders. Intermediaries are found to play several important roles in the ecosystem: (i) they increase the accessibility and utility of data; (ii) they may assume the role of a “keystone species” in a data ecosystem; and (iii) they have the potential to democratize the impacts and use of open data. The article concludes that despite poor data provision by government, the public university governance open data ecosystem has evolved because intermediaries in the ecosystem have reduced the viscosity of government data. Further increasing the fluidity of government open data will improve access and ensure the sustainability of open data supply in the ecosystem. © 2015 The Author(s).

Currently, administrations have access to vast amounts of information stored in closed databases, which is only available to a small number of individuals and organizations. This situation produces a significant asymmetry of information and frictions between governments and the citizenry, which have the potential to undermine democratic legitimacy by creating distance between governors and the governed. Digital technology and culture, which are being incorporated into society in an unstoppable process, create a world that is more transparent, and creative processes that are more participatory and collaborative. These are examined as elements that are disruptive of the democratic process.

Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are established as drivers of this new wave of change in the redefinition of the relationship between the city and its citizens. Smart Cities rely strongly on strategies and solutions enabled by ICTs involving directly local governments, citizens and communities. Open data alone, though a relevant component of these strategies, cannot provide enough incentives for the engagement of citizens necessary to establish a collaborative and open governance system; data need to be appropriately elaborated, communicated and used. The main objective of this paper is to investigate how open data together with simple and standardised elaborations and innovative visualisation techniques may be used to provide new and updated services to citizens and communities: free and readily available services based on the wealth of information ‘owned’ by local governments. Adopting a design science research methodology we develop and test a collaborative ICT-based tool called UrbanSense. We use it to highlight how systemic connections between citizens and city-government may be devised. On this point, the focus is on the feedforwarding of open data integrated with basic elaborations and visualisations as a means for the local government to create new and open services for citizens and communities. The use of the services prompts citizens to feedback new information in real-time to the city government. These interactions may be used to foster an open innovation ecosystem. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {China retains a bilateral and regional cooperation approach or a geopolitical strategy to secure its energy security, while it seeks to embrace global energy governance and more actively participate in global climate change negotiations. It has also been focusing on developing clean and renewable energy since early in the 21st century. China's new Belt and Road initiative contributes to a 2.0 version of its current geopolitical strategy to secure its energy supply. Although China's emphasis on energy security still corresponds to its geopolitical strategy, its weak participation in global energy governance is due to the fragmented global energy governance system that it sees as neither authoritative nor credible, as well as to the lack of willingness or impetus for its own domestic energy institutions to join the system. Taking into account the difficulties and potential of current global energy governance, this article suggests it is reasonable to seek a limited goal for coordinating regimes instead of creating coercive institutions in this field. Attainable goals in the near future should focus on promoting a transparent international market and establishing data-sharing mechanisms between governments and energy intergovernmental organizations and between producers and consumers. There should be emphasis on climate change and clean energy governance under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Group of 20 (G20) of should play an increasingly significant role in global energy governance. China, with its positive attitude and active participation in the G20 and as host of the G20 summit in 2016, should participate more actively, perhaps even playing a leading role in global energy governance under the G20 framework.},

In order to help bring about a better understanding of the common and differentiating elements in open data benchmarks and to identify the methodologies and metrics affecting their variation, this article compares open data benchmarks and describes lessons learned from their analysis. An interpretive meta-analysis approach was used and five benchmarks were compared with regard to metadata (key concepts, themes, and metaphors), meta-methods (methodologies underlying the benchmarks) and metatheories (theoretical assumptions at the foundation of the benchmarks). It was found that each benchmark has its strengths and weaknesses and is applicable in specific situations. Since the open data benchmarks have a different scope and focus and use different methodologies, they produce different results in terms of country ranks. There is an obvious gap in both the literature and benchmarks regarding the evolution of end-user practices and individual adoption of open data. Furthermore, lessons are drawn for the development of more comprehensive open data benchmarks and open government evaluation in general. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.},

The demand for new services also promotes renewed entrepreneurship centred on responding to new social and territorial needs through new technologies.

Furthermore, impact is elusive in most countries. Investigating what preconditions allow societies to realize impact can help inform policy makers, technologists, and civil society leaders on best practices to implement open data tools and policy. This paper looks specifically at the social impact of open data, described as marginalized groups having greater access and participation in government decision making.

In this paper, we investigate the determinants of trust in sustainable product information through a survey administered in Mexico and the United States. Our results suggest that information indicating brands and certificates reputation are important factors that encourage the development of trust. Our results also suggest that additional information to verify labels does not emerge as significant predictor to induce trust. We argue that to be useful, such information should be aggregated and presented to consumers in a simple way right at their fingertips. Finally, we found that information indicating support from government agencies and endorsement from non-for-profit organizations significantly influence consumer's trusting beliefs on sustainable practices information. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {In this paper a framework is constructed to hypothesize if and how smart city technologies and urban big data produce privacy concerns among the people in these cities (as inhabitants, workers, visitors, and otherwise). The framework is built on the basis of two recurring dimensions in research about people's concerns about privacy: one dimensions represents that people perceive particular data as more personal and sensitive than others, the other dimension represents that people's privacy concerns differ according to the purpose for which data is collected, with the contrast between service and surveillance purposes most paramount. These two dimensions produce a 2 × 2 framework that hypothesizes which technologies and data-applications in smart cities are likely to raise people's privacy concerns, distinguishing between raising hardly any concern (impersonal data, service purpose), to raising controversy (personal data, surveillance purpose). Specific examples from the city of Rotterdam are used to further explore and illustrate the academic and practical usefulness of the framework. It is argued that the general hypothesis of the framework offers clear directions for further empirical research and theory building about privacy concerns in smart cities, and that it provides a sensitizing instrument for local governments to identify the absence, presence, or emergence of privacy concerns among their citizens. © 2016 The Author},

The platform is the result of an ongoing project funded under the EU ICT PSP call 2011.

Design/methodology/approach: A two-year case study of a data sharing project between a UK fire and rescue service, local council, NHS primary care trust and a police force was undertaken. Findings: It is important to carefully determine the requirements for data sharing, to establish data sharing agreements, to have secure arrangements for data sharing, and to ensure compliance with data protection legislation. Research limitations/implications: Data sharing between public sector organisations can operate effectively if appropriate care is taken when creating data sharing agreements between partner organisations. Practical implications: Data sharing can assist in reducing duplication of effort between public sector organisations and can reduce costs and enable more co-ordinated provision of public services. Originality/value: The detailed analysis of a data sharing case study identified the need for a systematic data sharing framework. Such a framework is proposed and illustrated with practical examples of specification, implementation and evaluation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Open data are often associated with realizing ambitions, such as a more transparent and efficient government, solving societal problems and increased economic value. However, between proposing an open data policy and successful implementation are some practicable obstacles, especially for government agencies required to generate sufficient revenue to cover their operating costs, so-called self-funding agencies. With lost revenue due to open data, there is a real risk that the update frequency and the quality of data may suffer or that the open data policy may even have to be reversed. This article has researched the financial effects of open data policies for self-funding agencies on their business model.

However, scholarly efforts providing elaborations, rigorous analysis and comparison of open data models are very limited. This could be partly attributed to the fact that most discussions on Open Data Business Models (ODBMs) are predominantly in the practice community. This shortcoming has resulted in a growing list of ODBMs which, on closer examination, are not clearly delineated and lack clear value orientation. This has made the understanding of value creation and exploitation mechanisms in existing open data businesses difficult and challenging to transfer. Following the Design Science Research (DSR) tradition, we developed a 6-Value (6-V) business model framework as a design artifact to facilitate the explication and detailed analysis of existing ODBMs in practice. Based on the results from the analysis, we identify business model patterns and emerging core value disciplines for open data businesses. Our results not only help streamline existing ODBMs and help in linking them to the overall business strategy, but could also guide governments in developing the required capabilities to support and sustain the business models. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

It studies the impact of the international rankings on the national e-government development plans, including the adjustment of the areas of e-government, and reviews the balance between indicators, included in international ratings and the domestic policy of the state in this area, determined on the basis of socio-political, economic and cultural characteristics of specific states. The specific development of the concept of "open government" as well as the tendency towards publishing "open data" are included in the analysis as a major trend in the formation of e-government. The authors emphasize the political effects of the publication of open data, including the ability of society to monitor and control the activity of the authorities on the basis of publicly available information. The article explores the complex issues of institutional provision of e-government development, including the establishment of the legal framework and the allocation of specialized government agencies responsible for the development and implementation of state policy in this area. The article provides an overview of the basic conceptual documents defining the characteristics of e-government in the United States. Based on the analysis of these documents it concludes that in the US the existing trend is towards the use of mobile communication and significant attention to security, reliability and accuracy of information in provision of public services through electronic means. Considering the record of e-government in China, it draws attention to the influence of the bureaucratic and the ideological inertia on the introduction of information and communication technologies in the activities of public authorities. © 2017 Academic Educational Forum on International Relations.

If framed in the context of open, transparent and accountable governance then presumably VGI should advance dialogue and consultation between citizen and government. If governments perceive citizens as consumers of services then arguably such democratic intent elide when municipalities use VGI. Our empirical research shows how assumptions embedded in VGI drive the interaction between citizens and government. We created a typology that operationalises VGI as a potential act of citizenship and an instance of consumption. We then selected civic apps from Canadian cities that appeared to invoke these VGI types. We conducted interviews with developers of the apps; they were from government, private sector, and civil society. Results from qualitative semi-structured interviews indicate a blurring of consumer and citizen-centric orientations among respondents, which depended on motivations for data use, engagement and communication objectives, and sector of the respondent. Citizen engagement, an analogue for citizenship, was interpreted multiple ways. Overall, we found that government and developers may increase choice by creating consumer-friendly apps but this does not ensure VGI offers an act of civic participation. The burden is placed on the contributor to make it so. Apps and VGI could potentially further a data-driven and neoliberal government. Planners should be mindful of the dominance of a consumer-centric view even as they assume VGI invariably improves democratic participation. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).},

These APIs play a crucial role in realizing the benefits of open data as they are the means by which data is discovered and accessed by applications that make use of it. This article proposes semantic APIs as a way of improving access to open data. A semantic API helps to retrieve datasets according to their type (e.g., sensor, climate, finance), and facilitates reasoning about and learning from data. The article examines categories of open datasets from 40 European open data catalogs to gather some insights into types of datasets which should be considered while building semantic APIs for open government data. The results show that the probability of inter-country agreement between open data catalogs is less than 30 percent, and that few categories stand out as candidates for a transnational semantic API. They stress the need for coordination-at the local, regional, and national level-between data providers of Germany, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. © 2016, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

The conceptualization is based on a review of popular Open Data definitions and business ecosystem theories, which are applied to qualitative empirical data. The work is informed by a combination of discourse analysis and a content analysis of in-depth interviews, undertaken during the summer of 2013. Drawing on the UK as a best practice example, the authors examine a set of structural business ecosystem properties: circular flow of resources, sustainability, demand that encourages supply, and dependence developing between suppliers, intermediaries, and users. The authors identify that gaps and shortcomings remain. Most prominently, demand is not yet fully encouraging supply and actors have yet to experience fully mutual interdependence. © 2014, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

	abstract = {Surveys are used by public authorities to monitor the quality and reach of public services and provide information needed to help improve them. The results of such surveys tend to be used in internal reports, with highly aggregated summaries being released to the public. Even where data are released, many citizens do not have the capability to explore and interpret them. This offers limited scope for citizens to explore the results and use them to help hold service providers to account – objectives that are increasingly important in public service provision. We work closely with an English local authority to develop an innovative interactive interface to a citizen survey to demonstrate what can be achieved by applying a visual approach to the exploration of such data. In so doing, we (a) make a case for web-based interactive visualization to make this kind of information accessible both internally to those working in local government and externally to citizens in a way that is not achieved through a regular Open Data release or existing applications; (b) use techniques from both cartography and information visualization to inform the design of fluid visual interactions that enable diverse users – from the casual citizen browser to those interested in more in-depth analysis – to view, compare and interpret the survey outputs from a wide variety of perspectives and (c) document the experiences and reactions to the provision of information in this form, with log analysis playing a role in this exercise. Our reflections on our successes and otherwise will inform future exploratory interface design to help citizens access information and hold public service providers to account. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor \& Francis.},

Using the efforts and obligations of the Canadian federal government as a case study, the authors identify the challenges posed by developing and implementing an open data agenda within an officially bilingual state. Key concerns include (1) whether open data initiatives might be used as a means to outsource some information analysis and information services to an unregulated private sector, thus directly or indirectly avoiding obligations to provide these services in both official languages; and (2) whether the Canadian government’s embrace of the innovation agenda of open data leaves minority language communities underserved and under-included in the development and use of open data. © 2015, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

	abstract = {The object of this study is the characteristics of the development of the present-day national education systems in two leading economies of the Asia-Pacific region (APR), Japan and the Republic of Korea (Korea). Its main purpose is a comparative analysis of the aspect of the state's education policy dealing with enhancing the national markets for educational services by means of internationalization. The study's methodology is founded on the analysis of the logic behind the development of the national education systems based on an evolutionary approach that is inclusive of history, culture, demographic policy, the market for educational services, and the idea of integration of education systems. The authors employ classification and comparative analysis. They use as source information open data from the official websites of companies specializing in worldwide university rankings and of institutions dealing with education, culture, sports, and technology in Japan and Korea. Results and discussion. Over the last couple of decades, the development of the education system in Korea has been distinguished by a revolutionary and innovative spirit, propelling the nation into leading positions within the education market in the APR. The Korean government is encouraging the nation's colleges to take on a primary role as regional centers engaged in the production of new knowledge and skills, which may help drive technological and regional growth throughout the APR. Based on the World University Rankings, South Korea is currently ranked 9th and Japan 10th globally in higher education. Conclusion. The findings of the authors' analysis of the major aspects of the internationalization of the education systems indicate that both in Korea and in Japan the process of education internationalization is increasingly gaining momentum. The reasons here are pretty much the same - globalization and demographic declines. The two systems differ in that in Korea preference is given to the scientific component of universities, while in Japan it is the development of the educational segment. In Korea, international education is entirely regulated by the state, while Japan's current internationalization model is transitive - there is a shift taking place from government regulation to market freedom. The prospects for the continuation of this research, apparently, lie in expanding the cross-border networked interaction of APR universities. © 2017 by Academic Publishing House Researcher s.r.o.

	abstract = {This paper explores how real-time data are made available as “open data” using municipal transit data as a case study. Many transit authorities in North America and elsewhere have installed technology to gather GPS data in real-time from transit vehicles. These data are in high demand in app developer communities because of their use in communicating predicted, rather than scheduled, transit vehicle arrival times. While many municipalities have chosen to treat real-time GPS data as “open data”, the particular nature of real-time GPS data requires a different mode of access for developers than what is needed for static data files. This, in turn, has created a conflict between the “openness” of the underlying data and the sometimes restrictive terms of use which govern access to the real-time data through transit authority Application Program Interfaces (APIs). This paper explores the implications of these terms of use and considers whether real-time data require a separate standard for openness. While the focus is on the transit data context, the lessons from this area will have broader implications, particularly for open real-time data in the emerging ‘smart cities’ environment. © 2016, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

	abstract = {Latin America is anticipated to be a major growth market for agriculture and production is increasing with use of technologies such as pesticides. Reports of contamination of aquatic ecosystems by pesticides in Latin America have raised concerns about potential for adverse ecological effects. In the registration process of pesticides, all countries require significant data packages on aquatic toxicology and environmental fate. However, there are usually no specific requirements to conduct an aquatic risk assessment. To address this issue, the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry organized a workshop that brought together scientists from academia, government, and industry to review and elaborate on aquatic risk assessment frameworks that can be implemented into regulation of pesticides in Latin America. The workshop concluded that the international framework for risk assessments (protection goals, effects, and exposure assessments, risk characterization, and risk mitigation) is broadly applicable in Latin America but needs further refinement for the use in the region. Some of the challenges associated with these refinements are discussed in the article. It was recognized that there is potential for data sharing both within and outside of the region where conditions are similar. However, there is a need for research to compare local species and environmental conditions to those in other jurisdictions to be able to evaluate the applicability of data used in other countries. Development should also focus on human resources as there is a need to build local capacity and capability, and scientific collaboration and exchange between stakeholders in industry, government, and academia is also important. The meeting also emphasized that, although establishing a regionally relevant risk assessment framework is important, this also needs to be accompanied by enforcement of developed regulations and good management practices to help protect aquatic habitats. Education, training, and communication efforts are needed to achieve this. Key Points: Participants at a SETAC workshop concluded that the international framework for risk assessment of pesticides in aquatic systems is applicable but needs further refinement to be made specific for Latin American uses of pesticides. Of the countries in the survey, Brazil and Peru were the only countries with a framework for environmental risk assessment included in their legislation, and only Peru's legislation included specific protection goals Research is needed to compare local species and environmental conditions, to evaluate applicability of data generated in other jurisdictions and to characterize pesticide use in each country. Risk assessment of pesticides is important but there also needs to be a focus on good management practices to protect aquatic habitats. © 2014 SETAC.},

In this article, we shed light on two elements that many “smart cities” claim to integrate: open data and collaborative/participatory governance. Notably, we investigate whether the common claim in the smart city literature that open data can promote more participative and collaborative forms of governance passes the test of additional theoretical interrogation. We criticize that while this literature has noticed the importance of participation and collaboration, the meaning of the concepts has remained vague. Therefore, we introduce a concrete yet comprehensive framework of collaborative governance from which we derive three theoretical assumptions regarding the potential influence of open data on collaborative processes in a smart city context: overcoming knowledge asymmetries, facilitating joint fact finding and enabling trust building. We conclude by outlining how our theoretical framework could guide further empirical research on the exact relation of smart cities, collaborative governance and open government data. © 2014, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

Technologies play an important role in making this connection, and one frequent way that cities connect with citizens is through 311-style request systems. 311 is a non-emergency municipal notification system that uses telephone, email, web forms, and increasingly, mobile applications to allow citizens to notify government of infrastructure issues and make requests for municipal services. In many ways, this process of citizen contribution mirrors the provision of volunteered geographic information, that is spatially-referenced user generated content. This research presents a case study of the city of Edmonton, Canada, an early adopter of multi-channel 311 service request systems, including telephone, email, web form, and mobile app 311 request channels. Three methods of analysis are used to characterize and compare these different channels over three years of request data; a comparison of relative request share for each channel, a spatial hot spot analysis, and regression models to compare channel usage with sociodemographic variables. The results of this study indicate a shift in channel usage from traditional to Internet-enabled, that this shift is mirrored in the hotspots of request activity, and that specific digital inequalities exist that reinforce this distinction between traditional and Internet-enabled reporting channels. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).},

It looks at whether the new data have driven increased democratic accountability, public participation, and information transmission. The evidence suggests that the local government spending data have driven some accountability. However, rather than forging new 'performance regimes', creating 'armchair auditors', or bringing mass use and involvement, the publication creates a further element of political disruption. Assessment of the use and impact of the new spending data finds it is more complex, more unpredictable, and more political than the rhetoric around Open Data indicates. The danger is that the gap between aims and impact invites disappointment from supporters. © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

However, many potential data providers are unwilling to publish their data and at the same time, data users are often faced with difficulties when attempting to use Open Data in practice. Despite various barriers in using and publishing Open Data still being present, studies which systematically collect and assess these barriers are rare. Based on this observation we present a review on prior literature on barriers and the results of an empirical study aimed at assessing both the users’ and publishers’ views on obstacles regarding Open Data adoption. We collected data with an online survey in Austria and internationally. Using a sample of 183 participants, we draw conclusions about the relative importance of the barriers reported in the literature. In comparison to a previous conference paper presented at the conference for E-Democracy and Open Government, this article includes new additional data from participants outside Austria, reports new analyses, and substantially extends the discussion of results and of possible strategies for the mitigation of Open Data barriers. © 2017, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

We argue that current open data platforms do not take into account the complexity of democratic processes which results in overly simplistic approaches to open data platform design. Democratic processes are multifaceted and open data can be used for various purposes, with diverging roles, rules and tools by citizens and public administrators. This study develops a Democratic Activity Model of Open Data Use, which is illustrated by an exploratory qualitative multiple case study outlining three democratic processes: monitorial, deliberative and participatory. We find that each type of democratic process requires a different approach and open data design. We conclude that a context-sensitive open data design facilitates the transformation of raw data into meaningful information constructed collectively by public administrators and citizens. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

Other governments, including Australia, with a national map of 2D map information have not yet provided GIS-based open data and open application programming interfaces (APIs). On the other hand, the Korean government has actively opened up GIS-based information called VWorld and open APIs. However, the building industry has not yet exploited this information, and it seems to lack accessibility. Therefore, authors aim to support fast and expanding open data and propose a middleware that uses VWorld as a target platform for searching, processing, and generating GIS-based open data toward realizing building information modelling (BIM) exchangeable information. A Web 2.0 based middleware should be different from a Web 1.0 counterpart so that open data from suppliers are guided and delivered to data consumers in customized data formats. Authors expect that this study will serve as a general guiding approach for harvesting GIS-based open data as soon as other governments provide open data in the near future. Therefore, it should lead to dramatic improvements in acquiring environmental information relevant to building design, thus enabling better decision-making during design. © 2016, Architectural Institute of Japan.

Open data are often provided with no guarantee about their veracity, continuity or lineage (in terms of documentation that establishes provenance). This allows data providers to share data with undocumented errors, absences and biases. These quality issues can propagate through systems and lead to poor software applications and unreliable 'evidence-based' decisions. In this article, we highlight the janitorial role carried out by data scientists and developers to ensure that data are cleaned, parsed, validated and transformed for use. This process requires effort, knowledge and skill but is rarely shared.

	abstract = {The retrofitting of less energy efficient building stock represents one of the most significant challenges in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Nowadays, the housing sector represents about 40\% of the energy consumption in the European Union. In this regard, the level of insulation installed in buildings is directly related to the energy efficiency of the building, and consequently to the urban area. In addition, several studies have shown that a comprehensive perspective of energy efficiency is needed, together with calculating the importance of introducing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. The purpose of this study is to develop a methodology to: first, measure the energy efficiency level of specific urban areas and their buildings using a geospatial model in an integral perspective; and second, the environmental impact caused by the refurbishment of these building façades using a LCA method. On the one hand, according to a bottom-up framework the quantitative and qualitative characterisation of the building stock façade at the urban scale is possible generating a georeferenced spatial data model of buildings using Geographic Information Systems. On the other hand, the environmental impact of the most usual constructive solutions to refurbishment building façades is calculated using the LCA methodology. The results obtained are merged and interpolated to the urban scale. The methodology is tested for the case study of blocks of flats in Barcelona using the open data of building stock from the Spanish Government. Firstly, this methodology provides more information in regard to urban areas as well as calculating their energy efficiency. Secondly, the study measures the renovation impact of the less efficient buildings. Finally, the results provide the basis for supporting decisions on building stock retrofitting for urban scale from a new approach, especially making the selection between various renovation scenarios much clearer. © 2017 WIT Press.},

In 2011, the copyright terms of this archive were changed to encourage the circulation and reuse of images. This decision echoes a broader trend towards the "opening" of large data sets on the Web ("open data," "open archives," "open government"). At the same time, the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict and the existence of contesting narratives of the creation of Israel threaten the integrity of the official national memory. In this context, what are the conditions and limits of "opening" the national photographic archive?

	abstract = {Sharing and reuse of scientific data, which can enhance the transparency and reproducibility of research and lead to the creation of new knowledge from existing data, is both a growing scholarly communication practice and an expanding area of interest in information science. However, much of the literature to date has focused on the data practices of scientists working in academic environments, with less research done on understanding the practices of scientists working in other types of environments, such as government or industry. This poster presents the results of a study in which data from a worldwide survey of scientists were analyzed to determine if differences in data practices, perceptions, and access to resources for data sharing existed between scientists who reported their primary work sector as academic and those who reported a non-academic primary work sector. Researchers' perceptions of data sharing and reuse were generally positive and did not differ significantly by work sector. However, differences were found in actual reported data sharing practices, even when controlling for researchers' age, geographic location, and subject discipline. Researchers outside of academia had lesser odds of reporting sharing all their data. Differences were also found in reported barriers to data sharing, as well as in reported access to and use of data sharing resources, suggesting that data sharing challenges faced by scientists working outside of academia may differ from those faced by their academic peers. Implications for the adoption of data sharing practices and technologies, as well as for knowledge sharing and creation across work sectors, are discussed, and suggestions are offered for further research.

More recently, there is an increase in popularity of the civic hackathon. These time-limited events gather tech enthusiasts, government workers and interested citizens, in a collaborative environment to apply government open data in developing software applications that address issues of shared civic importance. Building on the Johnson and Robinson (2014) framework for understanding the civic hackathon phenomenon, Canadian municipal staff with civic hackathon experience were interviewed about their moti vations for and benefits derived from participation in these events. Two broad themes emerged from these interviews. First, through the development of prototypical apps using municipal open data and other data sets, civic hackathons help put open data into public use. Second, civic hackathons provide government staff with valuable feedback about municipal open data sets informing and evolving future open data releases. This paper concludes with reflections for urban planners about how civic hackathons might be used in their practice and with recommendations for municipal staff considering using civic hackathons to add value to municipal open data. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).},

	abstract = {No longer restricted to access to information laws and accountability measures, “open government” is now associated with a broad range of goals and functions, including public participation, open data, the improvement of public services and government efficiency. The 59 country strong Open Government Partnership (OGP) suggests that consensus on the value of open government is emerging amongst public officials. Similarly, academics have shown a renewed interest in open government as they discuss, debate and critique the meaning and role of open government reforms today. Yet, despite the diverse aims and tools characterizing contemporary open government, public officials and academics typically approach the subject as a cohesive unit of analysis, making sweeping—and generally nonempirical—claims about its implications, without accounting for the homegrown flavours that may characterize open government in practice. Simply put, the practice and study of contemporary open government suffers a lack of definitional clarity: what exactly is open government today, and how does it vary across governments? In response to these questions, this paper analyses the content of open government policy documents in seven OGP member states (Azerbaijan, Brazil, Canada, the Netherlands, Kenya, United Kingdom, and the United States), providing the first systematic, empirically-grounded multicountry comparison of contemporary open government. The paper suggests where the term departs from and retains its original meaning, and how its definition varies across different governments. © 2014, Department for E-Governance and Administration.
