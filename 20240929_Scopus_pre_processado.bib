	abstract = {Most archaeological investigations in the United States and other countries must comply with preservation laws, especially if they are on government property or supported by government funding. Academic and cultural resource management (CRM) studies have explored various social, temporal, and environmental contexts and produce an ever-increasing volume of archaeological data. More and more data are born digital, and many legacy data are digitized. There is a building effort to synthesize and integrate data at a massive scale and create new data standards and management systems. Taxpayer dollars often fund archaeological studies that are intended, in spirit, to promote historic preservation and provide public benefits. However, the resulting data are difficult to access and interoperationalize, and they are rarely collected and managed with their long-term security, accessibility, and ethical reuse in mind. Momentum is building toward open data and open science as well as Indigenous data sovereignty and governance. The field of archaeology is reaching a critical point where consideration of diverse constituencies, concerns, and requirements is needed to plan data collection and management approaches moving forward. This theme issue focuses on challenges and opportunities in archaeological data collection and management in academic and CRM contexts.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

	abstract = {Environmental assessments (EAs) in Botswana are insufficiently influential in decision-making and have been criticised for contributing to extended transaction costs and timelines. Therefore, efforts to simplify EA have been undertaken. Whilst internationally, the value of EA is judged by its capability to raise the profile of environmental issues and enhance public participation in decision processes, current EA simplification interventions in Botswana aim at constraining access to environmental information, at reducing public participation provisions and at restricting the scope of environmental impacts to be evaluated. Ultimately, EA is intended to be replaced with outcome-based tools aiming to mitigate and compensate for environmental damage rather than avoiding it. The authors therefore suggest that simplification efforts in Botswana are bound to erode benefits associated with EA and are not fit for purpose. In this paper, three recommendations are offered: whilst outcome-based tools can be prepared for projects that were assessed by EA they must be firmly tiered to them. Furthermore, discretion in decision-making needs to remain in place, and data sharing should be enhanced by placing EA reports in the public domain. © 2024 The Author(s).
